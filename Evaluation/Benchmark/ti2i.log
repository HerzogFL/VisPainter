Ensemble Strategies (blue). Directly below, the process begins with a rectangular box labeled 'Raw Dataset Collection,' with arrows extending rightward.  From 'Raw Dataset Collection,' three parallel arrows lead to three processing boxes: 'Text Preprocessing,' 'Structured Data Preprocessing,' and 'Augmented Data Sources.' From 'Text Preprocessing,' two arrows exit to 'Features (TF-IDF, Embeddings, Syntax)' and 'Prompts Generation.' 'Structured Data Preprocessing' leads to 'Feature Engineering (Statistical, Temporal).'  All engineered features from 'Features (TF-IDF, Embeddings, Syntax),' 'Feature Engineering (Statistical, Temporal),' and 'Augmented Data Sources' converge with 'Prompts Generation' into the central box, 'Challenge Prediction Framework.'   Within 'Challenge Prediction Framework,' four horizontally stacked modules are present: 'Expert Rules (Green Outline),' 'Supervised Classifiers (SVM, RF, XGBoost) (Red Outline),' 'Large Language Models (GPT4, LLaMA) (Purple Outline),' and 'Ensemble Meta-learner (Blue Outline).' Arrows from each of these modules point right to a sub-box labeled 'Ensemble Voting & Calibration.'  From 'Ensemble Voting & Calibration,' a thick horizontal arrow leads to 'Interpretability Module' above and 'Feature Importance & Attribution' below, both boxed.

Both blocks are enclosed within a solid orange box, with the label 'auxiliary matrices' in red italicized font directly above the box. 6. Another '+' symbol to the right of 'A_mask,' followed by the 'P_adapt' block, a 2×2 grid of teal squares, labeled 'P_adapt' above in teal. 7. The 'V' block on the far right: a 3×3 matrix of light blue squares, labeled 'V' above in blue.  Solid black arrows indicate the flow from the 'softmax' label down and right through each block, showing the sequential operations.  Outside and beneath the large oval, three elongated grey rectangles are horizontally aligned. From left to right: the first is labeled 'Thinking,' the second 'Learning,' and the third 'Machines,' all in grey. 'Thinking' and 'Machines' have the sublabels 'xᵢ' and 'xⱼ' respectively in smaller grey font beneath them; 'Learning' is annotated as 'xₖ' below. Solid black vertical lines connect the 'Thinking' input to the bottom of the 'Q' and 'P_emb' blocks, 'Learning' to the 'K^T' and 'A_mask' blocks, and 'Machines' to the 'V' and 'P_adapt' blocks.

At the top-right, a sequence of solid black arrows represents data flow: an upward arrow from the 'Pre-Trained Transformer' leads to a beige rectangle labeled 'Task Output Layer' with a flame icon, followed by another upward arrow labeled 'Pooling' that terminates at a label 'Outputs' at the top edge of the diagram.  In the bottom-right, outside the main central box, there is an additional solid-bordered rectangular box labeled 'Auxiliary Processing.' Inside are two horizontally aligned beige rectangles: 'Auxiliary Feature Encoder' with a flame icon, and 'Meta-data Integrator' with a snowflake icon. These feed into the three embedder rectangles via solid arrows.  All modules are clearly demarcated with solid black borders, assigned specific icons (snowflake for frozen modules, flame for actively trained modules), and have uniform fill colors for distinct functional components. Italics is exclusively used for feature or specialization labels. The overall diagram presents comprehensive visual separation of each stage, explicit arrows for all data flows, and no gradient fills or dashed outlines."

ti2i_image_caption_60="A portrait canvas with an aspect ratio of approximately 4:5 (730 px × 968 px) is used. Around the full canvas, a solid medium-grey (#9b9b9b) rectangular border with a 2 px stroke marks the outer boundary, set 3 mm from the edge, with sharp corners. The diagram is precisely centred with uniform horizontal margins.  The main structure is a single vertical sequence of eight horizontally centred rectangles (each 4 px corner radius, 1.5 px black border), separated by equal vertical gaps of 8 px between them. From top to bottom, the modules are:  1. “Short-cutting”: Rounded rectangle, pastel yellow (#f6e38e) fill, bold black sans-serif text (“Short-cutting”, 9 pt), centred mid-rectangle. Width is 70% of canvas, height is 11% of width. 2. “MLP”: Rounded rectangle, light steel-blue (#b7cbea) fill, bold black text (“MLP”, 9 pt), centred. 3. “LayerNorm”: Rounded rectangle, #b7cbea fill, bold black text (“LayerNorm”, 9 pt), centred. 4. “Spatial Padding”: Rounded rectangle, #f6e38e fill, bold black text (“Spatial Padding”, 9 pt), centred. 5. “MHSA”: Rounded rectangle, #b7cbea fill, bold black text (“MHSA”, 9 pt), centred. 6. “LayerNorm”: Rounded rectangle, #b7cbea fill, bold black text (“LayerNorm”, 9 pt), centred. 7. “Residual Merge”: Rounded rectangle, #f6e38e fill, bold black text (“Residual Merge”, 9 pt), centred. 8. “Downsample/Pooling”: Rounded rectangle, #b7cbea fill, bold black text (“Downsample/Pooling”, 9 pt), centred.  Immediately below these, an inner vertical sub-block is enclosed in a medium-grey (#9b9b9b) solid rectangle (2 px, 4 px corner radius), aligned flush with the right edge of the main stack and beginning just below the “Downsample/Pooling” module. Within this inner border are three stacked yellow modules, each with 6 px vertical gaps:  9. “Channel Mixing”: Rounded rectangle, #f6e38e fill, bold black text (“Channel Mixing”, 9 pt), centred. 10. “Window Shift Masking”: Rounded rectangle, #f6e38e fill, bold black text (“Window Shift Masking”, 9 pt), centred. 11. “Patch Recombination”: Rounded rectangle, #f6e38e fill, bold black text (“Patch Recombination”, 9 pt), centred.  On the right side of the main stack, two solid black curly braces enclose successive groups:   – A long curly brace spans modules 1–4 and is labelled “T × (N + 1) × D”, 9 pt sans-serif, placed to the right of the brace.   – A second curly brace encloses modules 9–11 and bears the label “T × N′ × D”, 9 pt, to its right.  Solid black arrows (1.5 px, filled triangle tip 4 px) indicate the main forward path: each module connects vertically, bottom centre to top centre, through all eight main modules. Within the inner sub-block, solid arrows connect downward between each yellow rectangle.  To the left, a long solid vertical black line begins at the bottom left of the inner sub-block, runs upward hugging inside the global frame. At the vertical position of “Spatial Padding”, a hollow circle (10 px diameter, 1.5 px black border) denotes an addition node. From this node, a short solid arrow moves right and connects to the left edge of “Spatial Padding”. The vertical line continues up, and at the level of “MLP” is a second addition node (identical circle), from which a short solid arrow connects right to the left edge of “Short-cutting”.    Within the sequence, three parallel, evenly spaced upward solid black arrows lead from the top of “MHSA” to the bottom of “Spatial Padding”. Two solid arrows emerge from the right edge of “Spatial Padding” and lead into the right side of “MHSA”.  From the right edge of “Residual Merge,” an arrow splits: one branch circles back leftward with a hollow addition node below “Spatial Padding” and points to the left edge of “LayerNorm” (module 3), while another proceeds downward into “Downsample/Pooling”.  A third solid black curly brace on the extreme left encloses all modules from “Short-cutting” through “Patch Recombination”, labelled “Block Output: T × N′ × D” in 9 pt font.  All module labels use bold black sans-serif (Helvetica/Arial) text, 9 pt, centre-aligned. Dimension labels are plain black sans-serif, 8 pt. No gradients, no dashes in borders or arrows, no text outside module or dimension labels. All alignments, spacings, and sizing are precise and consistent for a clean, publication-quality vector-style deep learning block diagram."

Predicted state output:      • White rectangle (40 × 26 px, 1 pt black stroke), just outside violet rectangle right edge, “Xₖ|ₖ₋₁” (12-pt italic Times New Roman).    • Two outgoing black arrows:      - One thick (2 pt), upward parallel to dashed rectangles, bends 90° left at top band mid-height, enters cyan box and connects to horizontal line with “yₖ” label.      - Second arrow loops from this block, descending and curving left, reconnecting with the first “xₖ₋₁” block at the left edge.      - A third thin arrow (1 pt black) splits off downward to a small “archive” module (grey rectangle, 40 × 18 px, “archive” in 9-pt Arial).  STYLISTIC DETAILS   • All mathematical variables use italic Times New Roman; subscripts at 70 % size.   • Explanatory text (e.g. “training phase”, “features”, “time delay”) uses Arial.   • All modules are horizontally aligned; arrowheads are filled black triangles (6 × 8 px).   • Vertical arrows perfectly plumb, margins are generous on all sides.   • All color fills are solid, no gradients or dashed lines (except for specified “update set” arrow and ellipse sigma-points connection).   • Every module, label, arrow, and geometric detail is crisply rendered for publication clarity."
ti2i_image_caption_62="A clean, publication-ready system diagram is displayed in a 16:9 aspect ratio on a white background. All rectangles have sharp 90-degree corners except for the main bottom container, which features a 10-pixel corner radius and a transparent fill with a 2 px black outline. Every box and arrow has a solid 1.5 px black outline, with arrowheads as closed, filled black triangles measuring 7 px, set at a 45-degree angle. Text throughout is centre-aligned in 11 pt bold Helvetica, except for inner annotation text which appears in 9 pt Helvetica.  At the top central region is a mauve rectangle labeled “pCTR/pCVR” (x=35, y=2, w=30, h=6). Directly beneath and connected via a vertical black arrow is a peach rectangle labeled “MLP Tower” (x=35, y=12, w=30, h=6). A vertical arrow continues downward to the blue rectangle labeled “Feature Interaction Module” (x=20, y=22, w=60, h=8).   To the left and right of the Feature Interaction Module, two additional modules are positioned. On the left at (x=5, y=24, w=14, h=6), a light blue rectangle labeled “Context Encoder” is present. A curved arrow exits from the right edge of this Context Encoder and merges into the left edge of the Feature Interaction Module at y=26. Similarly, on the right at (x=81, y=24, w=14, h=6), a pale purple rectangle labeled “Temporal Fusion Block” appears, its left edge connected by a curved arrow to the right edge of the Feature Interaction Module at y=26.  Beneath the Feature Interaction Module, a yellow rectangle labeled “Feature Processing Layers” (x=25, y=33, w=50, h=6) is positioned, connected upward to the centre-bottom of the Feature Interaction Module via a vertical arrow.  To the left of the diagram, the Pin-ID and Knowledge-Graph embedding pipelines are vertically aligned. The Pin-ID pipeline consists of a light grey rectangle “Pin Embedding” (x=2, y=16, w=22, h=4), a salmon rectangle “Pretrained Large PinID Embedding Table” (x=2, y=22, w=22, h=6), and a light grey rectangle “Pin ID” (x=2, y=30, w=22, h=4), connected by vertical black arrows. A quarter-circle curved arrow exits the right edge of 'Pin Embedding' and curves to join the left edge of the Feature Interaction Module at y=26, joining with another curved arrow from the Knowledge Graph Embedding pipeline.  Below the Pin-ID path is the Knowledge-Graph path, with a light grey rectangle “Knowledge Graph Embeddings” (x=2, y=36, w=22, h=4) above a light red-orange rectangle “Pretrained Knowledge Graph Embedding Table” (x=2, y=42, w=22, h=6), which contains two lines of small, white annotation:  Line 1: “Advertiser ID, Item ID,”   Line 2: “Image Signature, User ID”.   A vertical arrow connects the two boxes, and another upward arrow rises from the bottom edge to the centre of the orange box. From the right edge of the “Knowledge Graph Embeddings” rectangle, a curved arrow merges with the Pin Embedding path before both connect to the left edge of the Feature Interaction Module.  On the far right, a large light green rectangle titled “User Seq Transformer” (x=78, y=24, w=18, h=8) is present. A curved elbow arrow leads from its centre-left edge, bending downward and left, terminating at the right edge of the Feature Interaction Module at y=26. Above this, a lavender rectangle labeled “User Profile Block” (x=78, y=16, w=18, h=5) is connected to the top edge of the User Seq Transformer by a straight vertical arrow.  Centered at the bottom is a large, rounded rectangle (x=5, y=43, w=90, h=14) with four equally sized vertical columns, each 22 units wide and separated by 4 units. Each column contains two stacked rectangles, all medium-light grey:  Column 1 (far left): upper “Pin Feature Embeddings” (x=8, y=46, w=18, h=4), lower “Pin Signals” (x=8, y=52, w=18, h=4).   Column 2: upper “User Feature Embeddings” (x=30, y=46, w=18, h=4), lower “User Signals” (x=30, y=52, w=18, h=4).   Column 3: upper “Pin-user Interaction Embeddings” (x=52, y=46, w=18, h=4), lower “Interaction Signals” (x=52, y=52, w=18, h=4).   Column 4 (far right): upper “User Seq Embeddings” (x=74, y=46, w=18, h=4), lower “User Seq Signals” (x=74, y=52, w=18, h=4).    A fifth, narrow column (x=95, y=46, w=8, h=10) lies to the immediate right of the four columns, with upper rectangle “Meta Features” (x=95, y=46, w=8, h=4), lower rectangle “Context Signals” (x=95, y=52, w=8, h=4).   Above the bottom container at (x=50, y=39, w=24, h=2), a pale turquoise rectangle labeled “Auxiliary Heads” is situated, with two vertical arrows: one down to the container’s centre-top, and one up connecting it to the Feature Processing Layers yellow box.  From the centre-top of each upper inner box within the four main columns and the “Meta Features” column, five vertical arrows extend directly upward, merging at a single point into a thickened 2 px black arrow before entering the centre-bottom of the yellow Feature Processing Layers rectangle at y=33.  An additional vertical arrow emerges from the centre-top of the Feature Processing Layers, extending upward and splitting into three parallel arrows horizontally: the central continues straight up to the blue Feature Interaction Module, the left and right arrows each curve outward (at x ≈20 and x ≈80), connecting to the lower inside edges of the Context Encoder and Temporal Fusion Block rectangles.   Between the Feature Interaction Module and MLP Tower, three vertical arrows run in parallel, equidistant, rising from the blue box’s top edge to the peach box’s bottom edge. Similarly, three parallel arrows ascend from the centre-top of the MLP Tower to the mauve pCTR/pCVR box above.   Padding of at least 4 units surrounds all modules and lines, ensuring clarity. The overall layout is geometric, clean, and highly detailed, presenting all labeled modules, connectors, and flow of information crisply."

ti2i_image_caption_67="The image depicts a high-resolution, 2-D scientific diagram on a white background, sized with a width-to-height ratio of approximately 5:4.  GLOBAL LAYOUT The diagram is divided vertically: the left main-model column occupies about 55% width and the right external adapter/gating column occupies about 45% width.  LEFT COLUMN (Main Model)  - The left column is split horizontally into two panels:   - Lower panel (height ≈40%): pale green (#E9F6E9), thin light border, labeled at the upper-left “LLaMA transformer × N-L” in light-gray, 8 pt, semi-transparent 45%.   - Upper panel (height ≈60%): matching pale green, thin border, upper-left label “LLaMA transformer × L”, formatted as above.  - A thick vertical blue arrow (#00688B), the residual stream, runs the entire height along the extreme left edge, ascending. At three evenly spaced points, it passes through dark teal filled circles (Ø18 px) containing white plus (+) symbols (cross bars 9 px).  - At the bottom left, outside the lower panel, there is italic gray (#565656) text 'Instruction', centered under the residual stream, 9 pt font.  - A very thin vertical gray arrow points up from the 'Instruction' label to a rounded black rectangle (80 × 26 px, 2 px corner radius) labeled 'Embedding' in bold white, 9 pt, centered.  - Above the 'Embedding' block, the residual stream enters a plus-in-circle (described above).  LOWER PANEL (LLaMA transformer × N-L) - Contains THREE repeated transformer sub-blocks, stacked vertically:   For each sub-block:     1. Horizontal blue arrow from the plus-circle enters a white RMSNorm rectangle (80 × 24 px, 2 px orange border #F78043), black bold “RMSNorm” (8 pt).     2. From RMSNorm, right-angle blue arrow moves upward into a forest-green rectangle (100 × 32 px, #79A97D), white bold “LLaMA Attention” (8 pt).     3. Narrow blue upward arrow enters a beige rectangle (#E6CCB3, 100 × 32 px), black bold “LLaMA MLP” (8 pt).     4. A thin cyan arrow loops from the right edge of the “LLaMA MLP”, leftward and downward (90° bent), entering the next upper residual plus-circle.  - The residual stream passes vertically through three plus-circles aligned to the left, connecting each transformer block.  - Above the third sub-block, blue arrow travels up to a stand-alone RMSNorm rectangle (as above), in the white space between panels.  UPPER PANEL (LLaMA transformer × L) - Contains TWO stacked transformer sub-blocks, formatted identically:   For each:     1. Input from previous RMSNorm enters plus-in-circle.     2. Residual path forms a horizontal blue arrow entering RMSNorm rectangle (styled as above).     3. Right-angle arrow goes into green “LLaMA Attention” rectangle.     4. Narrow upward arrow enters beige “LLaMA MLP” rectangle.  - From the right edge of the uppermost “LLaMA MLP”, a horizontal blue arrow connects to the right column gating mechanism.  RIGHT COLUMN (Adapter & Gating)  - At the top-right edge, THREE pastel-pink vertical external adapter blocks, each 110 × 100 px, rounded corners (4 px), light-pink fill (#FCE5E5), thin border.   - Adapters labeled “Adapter 1”, “Adapter 2”, “Adapter 3” at top-center, gray bold 9 pt.   - Each block contains:     • Upper half: green rectangle (#8DBB8D), centered white text “Self Attention”, 8 pt.     • Centered thin black multiplication symbol “×” below.     • Lower half: light-gray rectangle (#DFDFDF), black centered “Gating Factor”, 8 pt.  - Between the adapters and gating mechanism, a dark-cyan circle (Ø18 px) with centered white tilde “~” marks the learned gate.  - The horizontal blue arrow from “LLaMA MLP” enters the left edge of the tilde-circle.  - Three thin cyan arrows come from the right edges of all adapter blocks, merging into the tilde-circle.  - From the bottom of the tilde-circle, a vertical cyan arrow descends into a tall, baby-blue rectangle (120 × 130 px) labeled “MLP” in black bold, 9 pt, top-centered.    Inside this MLP rectangle, stack FOUR dark blue (#005F9E) horizontal bars (95 × 22 px each, 4 px vertical spacing), centered with white text:     • Top bar: “Linear:512→1”     • Second bar: “Linear:1024→512”     • Third bar: “Linear:dim→1024”     • Bottom bar: “Activation: GELU”, white bold, 8 pt  ADDITIONAL MODULES  - At the lower-right end of the MLP block, a thin cyan arrow leads to a small white rectangle (60 × 22 px, 2 px orange border) labeled “Output”, bold black, 9 pt, centered.  ARROWS & FONTS  - All arrows use filled equilateral triangle arrowheads (7 px side), matching stroke colors. - Fonts are modern sans-serif, consistent throughout. - Parallel arrows spaced by minimum 14 px gaps to avoid visual clutter. - All blocks are flat; no gradients, no drop-shadows.  All components are cleanly arranged with logical spacing, ensuring clear legibility and robust colorblind-friendly contrasts. The figure is fully readable at 300 dpi on A4 paper."

The interior is structured as a left-to-right data pipeline with six vertical zones, separated by uniform white spaces for clarity. Bold, crisp black arrowheads (solid, 6-px) connect zones to indicate flow.  ZONE 1 – “Instruction Dataset” (far left): • Enclosed by a rounded-corner rectangle outlined with a gold solid line (#F3C56B, 3-px). • Inside, eight horizontally centered rounded rectangles (ratio 4:1, 100% zone width) are neatly stacked:  1. Rectangle fill: pale peach (#FEE4C5); border: gold 2-px solid; label in bold black “Sample S₁”.  2. Identical rectangle: “Sample S₂”.  3. Identical rectangle: “Sample S₃”.  4. Identical rectangle: “Sample S₄”.  5. Rectangle: “Sample S₅”.  6. Rectangle: “Sample S₆”.  7. Centered vertical ellipsis “⋮” (three black dots) to indicate continuation.  8. Rectangle: “Sample Sₘ”. • At the bottom-center of the zone is a small beige cylinder database icon (38 px high, black outline), with the label “Instruction Dataset” below in 12-pt sans-serif.  Between ZONE 1 & ZONE 2: • A prominent, vertically-centered black ⊕ symbol (font size 36 pt) denotes concatenation.  ZONE 2 – “Augmented Reflection Module”: • Enclosed by a blue solid rounded rectangle (#70A1E2, 3-px). • Inside, five stacked bars, all equal in width:  a) Top bar: pastel rose fill (#FAD0D6), thin solid border #A45B68, label centered “Token Reflection”.  b) Second bar: pastel mint-green fill (#D1E8D1), border #669E6D, label “Sentence Reflection”.  c) Middle bar: pastel lemon fill (#FEF6C2), border #B7A40F, label “Paragraph Reflection”.  d) Fourth bar: lavender fill (#DDD4F2), border #6F63B8, label “Model Reflection”.  e) Bottom bar: light cyan fill (#D1F0F9), border #4EA8B8, label “Ensemble Reflection”. • Between each bar is a medium-sized, black ⊕ symbol (font size 24 pt). • A small, vertical black arrow (solid, 6-px) is drawn from the right side of each reflection bar, merging into a main horizontal pipeline.  Right edge of ZONE 2: • A thick, black, hollow arrow (double-stroke, 20 px head) points to ZONE 3.  ZONE 3 – “Multi-Metric Score List”: • Enclosed by a gold solid rounded rectangle (same style as ZONE 1). • Inside, six rounded rectangles, each shorter in height:  1. Pastel peach (#FEE4C5); bold black label “Score₁ = [1.90, 2.15, 3.01]”.  2. Identical rectangle: “Score₂ = [2.37, 1.98, 2.64]”.  3. Identical rectangle: “Score₃ = [4.01, 3.95, 4.12]”.  4. Identical rectangle: “Score₄ = [3.12, 2.87, 3.55]”.  5. Centered vertical ellipsis “⋮”.  6. Pastel peach: “Scoreₘ = [3.52, 3.20, 3.84]”. • Each score is shown as a vector in square brackets.  Between ZONE 3 & ZONE 4: • Above the connecting thick hollow arrow is bold black text “Sort (MMA)” where “MMA” stands for “Multi-Metric Aggregation”.  ZONE 4 – “Ranking Table”: • A tall, light-blue rectangular table (#C9DBF7 background, border #4A7AC9, 2-px). • Four columns: “Sample ID”, “Score1”, “Score2”, “Aggregate”, “Selected”. Headers in bold navy (#183A7B), centered. • Nine visible rows:  Row 1: ID 9836, 4.05, 4.15, 4.10, ✓ (green checkmark).  Row 2: ID 34616, 4.12, 4.15, 4.14, ✓.  Row 3: ID 2341, 4.14, 4.09, 4.12, ✓.  Row 4: ID 7428, 4.00, 4.14, 4.07, ✓.  Row 5: ID 9650, 3.98, 4.02, 4.00, ✓.  Rows 6-7: centered vertical ellipsis in each column.  Row 8: ID 1683, 0.51, 0.67, 0.59, ✗ (red cross).  Row 9: ID 46171, 0.49, 0.55, 0.52, ✗. • Faint horizontal grid lines (#9BB5E8, 1-px).  ZONE 5 – “Clustering & Filtering Branch” (to the right of ZONE 4): • A large black brace “}” spans the five top check-marked rows, curving rightward toward a teal polygonal clustering node (hexagon, filled #70CEC7, outline #13705C, 60 px tall) labeled “Cluster X”. • From the hexagon, two thick black arrows split rightwards:  – Upper arrow leads to a yellow-orange circle (74 px), background #F4D378, with a cute brown-white llama head.  – Lower arrow leads to a forest-green circle (74 px), background #91B169, containing a fluffy white sheep wearing a police hat and sunglasses. • The lower sheep circle connects vertically to a pastel teal cylinder (#B7E0D4, outline #13705C) labeled “kept samples”.  · Beneath the teal cylinder is another cartoon character: a sheep in full police uniform, holding a green clipboard (90 px tall). • The upper llama circle connects vertically to a beige cylinder (#EFD4B1, outline #B38B5A) with the label “filtered dataset”.  · Beneath the beige cylinder stands a white alpaca cartoon with a yellow ribbon around its neck, on a light-grey circle (90 px).  ZONE 6 – “Metadata & Annotations” (far right, final zone): • Enclosed in a violet solid rounded rectangle (#B5A3E7, 2.5-px), this slim column contains stacked icons/symbols:  – Top: Open “information” icon (blue, 22 px), labeled “Audit Log”.  – Middle: Green shield icon (24 px), labeled “Validated”.  – Bottom: Crimson flag icon (22 px), labeled “Flagged issues”. • Below, a horizontal bar (pastel yellow, #FEF6C2, 60 px x 14 px), labeled “Export: CSV | JSON | XLSX” in black, centered. • All icons are horizontally centered.  Text elements use 12-pt sans-serif, zone titles are 14-pt bold, and every major module is vertically centered within the main border. No gradients, dashes, or shadows are present; all lines are solid and colors are strictly soft pastel tones or designated hex codes. The diagram is visibly complex, highly structured, and visually balanced."
ti2i_image_caption_72="The canvas measures approximately 2000 px in width and 600 px in height, with a white background and ample whitespace between all elements. All lines, shapes, and boxes are rendered with flat vector colors and thin outlines, free of gradients or dashed strokes unless otherwise specified. The font is a Computer Modern–style serif in black at 90% opacity.  Two equal sections are present, each contained in a thick black solid-outlined rectangle. Each section occupies about 48% of the canvas width, with a narrow white gutter between them. Each rectangle’s title sits 18 px below the top edge, left-aligned, typeset in bold-italic, ≈34 pt font: “Sentence-level Self-Reflection” on the left, “Model-level Self-Reflection” on the right.  LEFT SECTION — “Sentence-level Self-Reflection”  On the leftmost strip, seven stacked rating-prompt cards are vertically arranged. Each card is a rounded rectangle (radius 14 px, stroke #888888, 1.2 px width, width 360 px, vertical spacing 12 px). Only the bottommost two cards (RP₆ and RP₇) are fully opaque; the five above (RP₁ to RP₅) are rendered at 25% opacity.  Each rating-prompt card header is a horizontal light-mint band (#CAE4D4, height 36 px, full card width, no stroke). Inside, “Rating Prompt RP₁ / RP₂ / … / RP₇” centered vertically, 22 pt bold.  Body of the bottommost card (RP₇) contains: “Assign a score from 1 to 5 to each assistant based on how  accurately they follow the input and output provided, ensuring  the score is represented clearly.” Text is left-aligned, 20 pt, with 1.25× line spacing.  To the immediate right, a vertical dotted line (#000000, dots diameter 3 px, 7 px gap) extends down the entire column. At five positions (vertically centered with RP₁, RP₃, RP₅, RP₆, and RP₇), a ⊕ symbol resides inside a hollow black circle (diameter 40 px, stroke 2.4 px). The symbol is 30 pt, centered.  Directly right, a tall rectangular region with orange dashed outline (#F68B59, dash 10 px, gap 6 px, stroke 2 px) contains a vertical stack of seven pink rounded boxes (corner radius 12 px, fill #F9C9CF, outline #B25D69 1.5 px), arranged with 25 px vertical gaps. Each box (170 px × 54 px) contains: S^{token}_{1} = 1.13 S^{token}_{2} = 2.38 … S^{token}_{7} = 1.69  A right-pointing black arrow (length 40 px, thickness 2 px, closed triangular head) departs from the middle right side of this dashed region, touching the next orange dashed block.  Next, a second orange dashed rectangle (same style), measures 220 px × 210 px. Inside, three pink rounded boxes stacked vertically (same style/size, vertical gap 18 px): — Top: “Avg = 1.95” — Middle: “Std = 0.23” — Bottom: “Median = 1.73”  A right-pointing arrow identical to the previous emerges from the mid-right side; above it sits the label “Eq. 4” (italic, 22 pt, dark grey), slightly offset upward.  Immediately to the right, two stacked light-green rounded rectangles (220 px × 66 px, corner radius 12 px, fill #D5EAD1, outline #7A9B74 1.5 px, 16 px vertical gap): — Top: “s^{sent}_{A} = 1.59” (centered) — Bottom: “s^{sent}_{B} = 1.85” (centered)  A solid horizontal black line (stroke 1 px) runs along the bottom boundary of the entire left section.  RIGHT SECTION — “Model-level Self-Reflection”  Three rows of llama icons are arranged horizontally at the top, evenly spaced (center-to-center gap ~230 px). Each icon is a circular avatar (diameter 114 px, border 2 px #000000, fill #FDBB57) containing a stylized cartoon llama head (tan fur, darker snout, two upright ears, simple flat illustration). Above each avatar, a model label in small caps, bold, 26 pt, 7 px above: “7B”, “13B”, “33B”. A fourth avatar (“70B”) sits below, centered, forming a diamond arrangement.  From the bottom of each badge, a vertical dotted line (#000000, dot diameter 3 px, 7 px gap, length 110 px) extends downward to a hollow ⊕ circle matching those on the left. From the “70B” badge, one dotted stem descends further to a large hollow ⊕ (diameter 50 px). All ⊕ circles are 40 px except the bottom, which is 50 px.  Below the top three ⊕ circles, three light-green rounded rectangles (220 px × 54 px, corner radius 12 px, fill #D5EAD1, outline #7A9B74 1.5 px) are horizontally aligned, evenly spaced. Texts: s^{sent}_{1} = 1.59 s^{sent}_{2} = 2.13 s^{sent}_{3} = 1.89  Enclosing these, a large horizontal dashed frame (dash color #6DBF7A, dash 10 px, gap 6 px, stroke 2 px) which extends a few pixels beyond the leftmost and rightmost rectangles.  Further below, two lavender rectangles (260 px × 66 px, corner radius 12 px, fill #DCC9F0, outline #9C83C2 1.5 px) are stacked with 14 px gap, each centered. Texts: Top: S^{model}_{avg} = 1.90 Bottom: S^{model}_{max} = 2.13  From the midpoint under the green dashed frame, a thick black downward arrow (80 px long, 2.5 px stroke, filled head) connects to the top lavender rectangle. To the right of the arrow shaft is the label “Eq. 5” (italic, 22 pt).  A second black downward arrow (60 px long, same style) links the top lavender rectangle to the bottom one; “Eq. 6” in italic, 22 pt, left of the shaft.  A solid horizontal black line (stroke 1 px) marks the bottom boundary of the right section.  All text inside colored rectangles is perfectly centered both vertically and horizontally, and all mathematical variables retain italic styling with appropriately scaled and baseline-shifted subscripts. There is ample white space throughout every module and element."

ti2i_image_caption_75="A horizontal, 3:2 aspect ratio, scientific vector diagram is set against a pure white background, divided into two equal-width main panels by a 40 px gutter. Each panel consists of a large, medium-gray (#E6E6E6) rounded rectangle (corner radius 15 px, 2-px black outline), with tops aligned. Within each panel, functional blocks are aligned along a vertical dataflow axis.  **Left Panel — “(b) Stage II: Expert Evolution”**  At the top, a wide horizontal pill (radius: 22 px; width: 85% of panel; height: 45 px; fill: butter-yellow #FAF3C0; 2-px solid black stroke) contains, on the left, a blue outlined snow-flake icon (six arms, white fill, 20 px), followed by bold black small-caps text “ADD & Norm” (14 pt, vertically centered). A solid black upward arrow touches the top edge, indicating output.  Below, a tall light-pink (#FFEDEC) rounded rectangle (radius: 10 px; 90% panel width; 180 px height; 1.5-px solid red outline) serves as the Expert-Evolution block. Centered at the top of this block is a large, dark-red, italic cursive “Evolution” (32 pt). Within the pink block, a horizontally-even chain of **four** powder-blue (#BFD9FF) squares (75 px, 2-px solid black border) illustrates expert modules, labeled in bold black text (12 pt, centered): “FFN 1”, “FFN 2”, “FFN 3”, “FFN N”. The first square (FFN 1) features a small red-orange flame icon in its top-left; the other three display blue snow-flake icons. A thick (3-px solid red) arrow begins at the right edge of FFN 1, arcs sequentially above each square, passing through FFN 2 and FFN 3 before ending in a red triangular arrowhead at FFN N, representing progression. From the bottom of the pink block, a 2-px solid black vertical arrow points down; a thinner black feedback arrow (1-px) loops clockwise from bottom edge to the left edge of the pink block.  Below, a middle horizontal pill (same style as above) is labeled “ADD & Norm”, with a snow-flake icon and a vertical black input arrow entering its bottom.  Next is a pastel-yellow (#FFEEB8) self-attention rectangle (45 px height, matching pill width), left-aligned snow-flake icon, and bold “Self-Attention” text, with a black vertical input arrow connected from token preparation below.

ti2i_image_caption_79="Canvas size is 1920×1400 px with a white background.   At the top, two horizontally-stacked block diagrams are aligned vertically, sharing equal left margins and separated by a 70 px vertical gap.  Diagram (a), titled in bold black Times New Roman 20 pt, left-aligned as '(a) MLC-SLM baseline+Advancements,' is positioned above the upper diagram.  Left-most is an audio input represented by three vertical black waveform bars of varying height (≈45 px), followed by a rightward solid black arrow (4 px thick, 90 px long) pointing to the 'Whisper Encoder' block. The Whisper Encoder is a 220 × 90 px rounded pale sky-blue rectangle, containing bold black Arial 18 pt text, centered over two lines: 'Whisper Encoder.' A 18 × 18 px snowflake icon sits 8 px from the top-left corner. Directly to its right, a 60 × 90 px narrow pastel-orange rounded rectangle overlays the block (no horizontal gap), labeled 'LoRA' in bold, with an 18 × 18 px fire emoji at the top-right.  A rightward arrow flows from this composite block to a stack of three horizontal beige feature bars (150 × 32 × 10 px), each bar separated by a 3 px vertical gap. Above the top bar is a small golden star icon (12 × 12 px) signifying enhanced features. Immediately right, a vertical black arrow splits off upwards to a new module: 'Noise Robustifier,' a rounded light-green rectangle (100 × 60 px) with centered text and a leaf emoji (14 × 14 px) at the top-left. From Noise Robustifier, a downward arrow rejoins the horizontal flow after the feature bars.  To the right, an arrow leads to the 'Projector' block, a 150 × 100 px pastel-orange rounded rectangle, centered bold black Arial label 'Projector,' with 18 × 18 px fire emoji top-right. A thin vertical blue rule (1 px, 60 px tall) divides the left edge to indicate feature adaptation.  A rightward arrow points to a tall cream-colored LLM column (170 × 250 px rounded rectangle). The column is partitioned horizontally by a thin grey rule 50 px (20%) from the bottom. Upper 80% contains bold centered text 'LLM.' Top-right corner: 18 × 18 px snowflake icon. Below the partition, lower 20% contains bold text 'LoRA' at the center and a fire emoji (18 × 18 px) at the bottom-right corner. A small shield icon (16 × 16 px) sits above the fire icon within 'LoRA.'  The final output arrow extends from the mid-right of the LLM block to the label 'Transcriptions' (black Arial 18 pt), positioned rightward.  Below the feature bar, two parallel horizontal paths originate from 'Text' and 'Prompt' (centered black Arial 18 pt), each leading to rightward arrows into a blue rounded rectangle 'Tokenizer' (150 × 100 px, bold centered label). Tokenizer has a snowflake emoji 18 × 18 px top-left. Arrows from Tokenizer flow upward and diagonally into the LLM block's 'LoRA' section. A small orange circle (12 px diameter) between the arrows indicates auxiliary fusion.  Diagram (b), labeled '(b) SHNU-mASR extensible architecture,' sits underneath in the same style.

Outputs from all three encoders converge by thick orthogonal arrows into a stack of four beige horizontal bars, each 150 × 10 px, 3 px vertically apart. Above the stack is a small gold star icon (12 × 12 px).  From feature bars, an upward arrow leads to a rounded green rectangle 'Feature Selector' (90 × 60 px) with a checkmark icon (14 × 14 px) top-left, then rejoins the horizontal flow into the Projector.  Rightward arrow to 'Projector' block (150 × 100 px pastel orange, fire emoji top-right), containing a thin vertical blue rule at the left edge. A smaller orange rectangle (40 × 40 px) inside the block, lower right, labeled 'Adapter' (black Arial 12 pt).  Arrow leads into the same style cream LLM column (170 × 250 px, rounded corners), partitioned by a thin grey horizontal rule 50 px from bottom. The upper 80% contains bold centered 'LLM' label; snowflake emoji top-right; a semi-transparent padlock icon (18 × 18 px) bottom-left. Lower 20%: bold centered 'LoRA,' fire emoji bottom-right, shield icon (16 × 16 px) above fire icon.  Final output arrow leads from LLM column to 'Transcriptions' label (rightward, black Arial 18 pt).  Bottom of the diagram: 'Text' and 'Prompt' blocks (centered), with rightward arrows feeding into a blue Tokenizer block (150 × 100 px, snowflake emoji top-left). Under Tokenizer, a rounded light blue rectangle (100 × 60 px) labeled 'Prompt Classifier,' with a magnifier emoji (16 × 16 px) top-left. Downward arrow from mHuBERT Encoder output flows into a 'LID-aware Prompt' label (centered black Arial 18 pt), then rightward arrow into Prompt Classifier, which outputs into Tokenizer via a short upward arrow.  Arrows from Tokenizer merge upward into the 'LoRA' section of the LLM column, with a small orange fusion circle at the junction.  Module blocks occupy equal horizontal spacing (120 px apart), arrows are thick and black (4 px width), orthogonal with 90-degree turns. Visual symmetry is preserved across both diagrams, resolution is 300 dpi suitable for print."

ti2i_image_caption_81="A high-resolution, vector-style scientific schematic diagram is presented on a very light warm-beige canvas (RGB 250-245-235). At the center-top is the title “(b) Framework of TVT-based Real-ISR” in bold, deep-black Times New Roman.  At the far left, two vertically aligned 96 px × 96 px square input/output photos are shown: the upper at approximately x=5%, y=18% and the lower at x=5%, y=76%. Both photos depict a modern glass skyscraper facade with a one-point perspective, dark-blue glass, and black mullions forming a diamond grid.  From the center-right edge of the upper photo, three arrows branch out: 1. The topmost black arrow (2 px width) leads horizontally right to a light-cyan rounded rectangle labeled “DAPE” (90 px × 35 px, bold Arial centered label), outlined in black. 2. The middle black arrow points diagonally downward-right into the left edge of a right-pointing isosceles trapezoid labeled “VAE-D4 Encoder.” 3. The lowermost black arrow points horizontally rightward into a small, vertical, pale-orange rectangle (60 px × 28 px, thin black border) labeled “Edge Det.” in black Arial, positioned between the DAPE and Encoder branches. From the right edge of the “Edge Det.” rectangle, a thin black arrow continues horizontally to merge with the bottom of the DAPE rectangle (indicating information fusion).  Immediately to the right of the DAPE rectangle, touching, is a second identical light-cyan rounded rectangle labeled “CLIP Text Encoder”; below the CLIP block, a medium blue 5-point snowflake icon (18 px) is shown. From the right edge of CLIP, a thin black horizontal arrow (length 110 px) points to the right margin; at the arrow tip, italicized black text reads “Text Embedding.” A vertical black dashed separator (not gradient, not colored) passes between the DAPE and CLIP rectangles.  From the right end of the “Edge Det.” rectangle, join a curving black arrow (2 px) merging with the downward-pointing black arrow entering the VAE-D4 Encoder block, signifying the input fusion.  The VAE-D4 Encoder block at x=26%, y=20% is a right-pointing isosceles trapezoid (left base 110 px, right base 70 px, height 150 px), filled with very light ice-blue (#d5e8ff), outlined with 2 px black. Inside, stacked bold black sans-serif text reads “VAE-D4” (top) and “Encoder” (bottom). Along the left slanted edge is “512 × 512” in vertical Arial, along the right slanted edge “128 × 128.” At bottom-center, a medium-blue 5-point snowflake icon (18 px).  From the right edge of the Encoder, two arrows emanate: 1. A straight horizontal black arrow (2 px, 70 px long) connects to a light-lilac rounded rectangle labeled “128 × 128 FPT” (90 px × 35 px), with two centered lines: “128 × 128” (top), “FPT” (bottom), in bold black. 2. A thinner, shorter black arrow arcs upward and right from the Encoder’s top-right edge into a small, rounded, light-gray rectangle (60 px × 28 px, thin black border), labeled “Noise Pred.” (bold Arial). A thin black arrow continues horizontally from the right edge of “Noise Pred.” rectangle into the top edge of the FPT block, depicting auxiliary input.  Below the first FPT rectangle, a thick green vertical arrow (#1cac1c, 4 px wide, solid triangular head) labeled “Down” in small green font on its left side connects to a double-hourglass (X-shaped) UNet block centered at x=54%, y=38%. The UNet consists of two mirrored isosceles trapezoids touching at their narrow ends, overall 90 px tall, 75 px wide at the waist, filled with pale steel-blue (#dde6f5), thin black outline.  Within the UNet waist, a 46 px × 34 px rounded rectangle filled pastel pink (#f6c2c2) with 2 px border contains centered, bold black text “LoRa.” Immediately to the right of the waist is a stylized red-orange flame icon (18 px tall) followed by bold, dark-red “UNet” label.  At the UNet’s broad upper-left and lower-right corners, two small purple circles (12 px diameter, solid fill) are positioned; thin solid black arrows (2 px) enter these from above and exit below, signifying skip connections.  From the bottom of the UNet, a thick green arrow exits downward, then curves and turns upward, entering a second light-lilac rounded rectangle “128 × 128 FPT” located below the first (vertical distance ~110 px); the upward arrow is labeled “Up” in small green font adjacent to it.  Below and slightly to the right of the lower FPT rectangle, a light-orange diamond (32 px wide, 2 px black border) labeled “Fusion” in small bold Arial receives a thin black diagonal arrow from the lower FPT block and a horizontal arrow from the right; from the diamond’s right edge, a thin black arrow curves leftward to join with the input arrow entering the Decoder, reflecting data merging before decoding.  To the left, the VAE-D4 Decoder block at x=26%, y=74% mirrors the Encoder: a left-pointing isosceles trapezoid (same size/color as Encoder), 2 px black border, stacked bold black text “VAE-D4” / “Decoder.” “128 × 128” is along the right edge, “512 × 512” left edge, vertical Arial, with a blue snowflake icon at the bottom-center.  From the left edge of the Decoder, a short black arrow returns to the lower photo, representing output.  Additionally, to the immediate right of the Decoder, a vertical stack of three small rectangles (each 40 px × 18 px, various light pastel fills) is labeled, top to bottom: “Refine1,” “Refine2,” “Refine3” (centered in Arial); from each, a thin solid black horizontal arrow curves and merges with the main decoding arrow, illustrating iterative refinement.  All arrows and module outlines are solid black or green, 2 px (black) or 4 px (green), arrowheads closed/solid and not dashed. Fonts for module labels are bold Arial with dimension texts in regular Arial 9 pt. Every block and photo casts a subtle grey drop-shadow (40% opacity, 2 px offset) for depth. Ample white space is maintained; total diagram width occupies ~80% of the canvas, centered horizontally. All colors are flat, no gradients except a subtle photo bevel. Crisp anti-aliased lines throughout."
ti2i_image_caption_82="The illustration presents a comprehensive schematic arranged on a 16:9 landscape canvas (2800 × 1600 px) with a uniform very-light pastel blue (#d7e7f9) background. All lines, outlines, and arrows use pure-black color with 2 px width and closed triangular arrowheads. Text employs black sans-serif scientific fonts (Helvetica Neue), with size and weight indicating hierarchy.  At the top-left, a title strip sits flush with a 20 px margin, reading “(a) Expanded Organ Queries Generation Pipeline” in bold. The baseline is positioned 60 px from the top edge.  On the left border, vertically centered at the 25% height, a black label “Image Inputs” introduces three horizontally arranged rectangular modules: “MRI”, “CT”, and “Ultrasound”. These blocks, each 90 × 60 px, filled pastel purple (#eedafd), pastel green (#e3ffd9), and pastel blue (#cadcff) respectively, are spaced 18 px apart. Each block bears its imaging type label in bold centered text. Three arrows converge rightward from these blocks into a shared horizontal black arrow (length 140 px) enterring a “Vision Encoder.”  The Vision Encoder appears as a large isosceles-trapezoid prism, fill bright-sky blue (#5fa4ff), outlined in 3 px black. It measures 220 px width and 160 px height, with the wider base on the left, tapered right. Centered within, “Vision Encoder” is labeled in bold black. Below its base, a smaller black sublabel reads: “Visual Features Fᵢ   HᵢWᵢDᵢ × Cᵢ”.  To the immediate right, after a 40 px gap, a mirror symmetric trapezoid—“Vision Decoder”—shares dimensions and outline, with “Vision Decoder” in bold centered text.  Between Encoder and Decoder, a vertically stacked set of four cyan semi-transparent rectangles (80 × 50 px) signals a feature map stack, each offset for depth. A vertical black arrow (70 px) from the midline below points upward toward the stack, labeled beneath the base “Fᵢ” in italic.  Centered horizontally, 80 px above this stack, sits a rounded-rectangle (corner radius 12 px, 200 × 90 px) filled vivid mint-green (#7fe9bf), bold black outline (3 px), labeled “kMMM Decoder” in bold centered text.  To the left of the kMMM Decoder, a vertical stack of five solid circles (diameter 22 px, gap 12 px): pale-rose pink, warm yellow, light cyan, light lime (#e7f981), and pale lavender (#ceb6fc). Left of the stack, a dual-line black label reads “Organ Queries O” and below it “Nₒ × C” in smaller text. A horizontal arrow (80 px) points right from the stack into the left face of the green block.  To the right of kMMM Decoder, an identical vertical stack of five colored circles is presented. Alongside, black arrows move right toward three vertically stacked slim vertical MLP blocks (each 40 × 80 px, fill mid-grey #bfbfbf, black outline), labeled “MLP” vertically (rotated 90°). Each MLP in the stack is separated by 15 px.  Three arrows, one from each MLP block, continue right into three horizontally aligned rounded rectangles (120 × 80 px) filled light rose (#ffb2b2), labeled (top to bottom): “Class”, “Type”, “Site” in bold centered text. Below each rectangle, a respective small black label: “BCE Loss”, “Cross-Entropy Loss”, “Contrastive Loss”.  Below the top query block, a horizontal pale grey rectangle (110 × 36 px, outlined 2 px black) titled “Attention Scores” sits, receiving an upward arrow from the kMMM Decoder’s bottom face and a leftward arrow from the feature map stack.  From the right tip of Vision Decoder, an arrow (110 px) travels right and bends down at a 90° elbow, marked “F₄” near the joint. After a vertical path (110 px), it reaches a “circle-X” operator: a 60 px diameter circle outlined 3 px black, white fill, bold black “×” center. Below, the label “Query Response R₄   Nₒ × HWD”.  A vertical arrow (170 px) drops from the center of the right query stack (Ô₄) into the same circle-X operator.  From the bottom face of the circle-X, a vertical arrow (80 px) connects to another grey vertical MLP block (40 × 120 px), labeled “MLP” vertically (90° rotated). To its right, an arrow (80 px) proceeds into a pink rounded rectangle (120 × 80 px), labeled “Mask” in bold. Beneath, black text reads “Dice Loss”.  Above the mask arrow, just above the line, a black Ŷ (Y-hat) symbol is presented.  Extending from the bottom of the Mask block, a horizontal arrow (100 px) leads to an additional scoring module: a rounded rectangle (90 × 60 px, fill pale yellow #fff5b1), labeled “Quality Score Q” in bold.  At the bottom-right quadrant, two horizontally stacked rectangles (80 × 44 px each, 20 px gap): “Calibration”, filled pastel orange (#ffd9a3), and “Uncertainty”, filled pale teal (#b7ebf2), each with bold centered labels. Upward arrows from both feed into the “Quality Score Q” block.  All arrows are pure black, precisely aligned, incorporating only right-angle elbows. Arrowheads are consistently sized (9 px base, 12 px length). Parallel modules uphold a minimum spacing of 35 px for clarity and organization. No gradient or dashed lines appear throughout the illustration."

ti2i_image_caption_84="The illustration is a wide horizontal diagram with rounded corners and a pale beige background. It is bordered by a medium-gray thin outline and divided into three vertical zones: left (28% width), middle (24%), and right (48%). A light blue dotted diagonal guideline flows upward across the bottom third of the canvas.  In the left zone, the top-center displays the bold deep blue title “VIKI Dataset” in large sans-serif font. Below, a horizontal compositing box with thick navy outline and rounded corners contains, on its left, three overlapping 3-D kitchen robot screenshots at 45-degree tilt, borderless with light shadow. To their right are two sets of yellow file-folder icons with stacked white sheets outlined in dark navy, each sheet showing three magenta horizontal text lines. Centered between screenshots and file icons is a large bold golden yellow “+” sign. Beneath the box, the ChatGPT swirl logo in dark green with white fill, tilted slightly, is followed below by the bold orange-red label “CoT Generation.” Directly below, a thick banana yellow curved arrow with dark outline flows downward-right toward the middle zone.  In the middle zone, a tall rounded rectangle with pale peach fill and dark gray outline spans the full height. Top-right inside is the bold dark orange “Stage 1: SFT” title. Directly beneath, a miniature database cylinder of three stacked gradient orange disks has a butter-yellow “Warmup” tag with bold red text overlaying its bottom-right. Inside, two horizontal bands separated by a solid turquoise divider line appear. The upper band features left-aligned icons of two human heads with embedded pale yellow lightbulbs, and next to them is the label “CoT-SFT Model” in bold bright green. The lower band shows two yellow file-folder icons with blue pencils, and beside them the label “Ans-SFT Model” in matching green font. On the right edge at mid-height, a thick cobalt-blue right-facing arrow extends into the right zone.  In the right zone, a large pale peach rectangle with dark outline covers the zone. The top-left header inside reads “Stage 2: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning” in bold deep maroon. This block is split into three vertical rows.  The top row is labeled “Policy / Reference Models” and enclosed by a solid black outline rectangle. On the left, a long mint-green rounded rectangle labeled “Policy Model” in bold forest-green sits beneath a flame emoji icon. On the right, a sky-blue rounded rectangle labeled “Reference Model” in bold navy is topped by a light cyan snowflake icon. Between them runs a thin solid line with arrowhead, pointing leftward from Reference Model to Policy Model, and above is annotated “KL Divergence” in brown italic font. Below both, three vertical arrows (magenta-red pointing up, pine-green pointing down, royal blue pointing left) display, labeled at their bases as “Sampled Candidate Responses” in brown font. Right of the downward green arrow is a small slate-gray rounded rectangle labeled “GRPO” in white caps.  The middle row is labeled “Adversarial Evaluation” in bold purple font, centered at top. The row is enclosed by a solid-edged rounded rectangle. Inside, two horizontally placed evaluation blocks are separated by a navy “+” sign: the left block is a powder-blue rounded rectangle with a shield icon (blue with checkmark) labeled “Robustness Score” in navy; the right block is a pale cream rounded rectangle with a target icon (red rings, purple center) labeled “Diversity Score” in deep orange.  The bottom row is enclosed with a solid goldenrod-edged rounded rectangle, titled “Rule-based Reward” in bold espresso-brown at center-top. Inside are three horizontally arranged reward blocks, separated by orange “+” signs: leftmost is a lavender-pink rectangle with clipboard-with-checklist icon labeled “Format Reward” in purple, center is a soft teal rectangle with handshake icon labeled “Consistency Reward” in teal, rightmost is a light beige rectangle with target-bullseye icon labeled “Accuracy Reward” in deep orange.  Inter-zone connectors show: from the bottom-center of Stage 1 rectangle, a sky-blue thick curved arrow flows into the Rule-based Reward block. From Rule-based Reward, a thick dark purple arrow curves upward into the Adversarial Evaluation row. From the Adversarial Evaluation row, a thick green arrow connects upward to the Policy Model of the top row, denoting feedback. Beneath the Policy/Reference row, “Policy Gradient Update” in brick-red, aligned under the upward red arrow.  All text uses a consistent sans-serif font style.

ti2i_image_caption_85="The schematic illustration occupies a horizontal canvas with a uniform pale-pink background (#f7e6f4), sized at a ratio of approximately 2.05:1. The figure is divided into two adjacent, large rounded rectangles, each with a 3 px black stroke and 18 px corner radius, placed side-by-side and touching at their vertical centre.  Block-A (left section, 925 px wide, 875 px tall) contains four convolution module boxes along its top row: 1. “Query-Conv” – lavender fill (#baa7ff), 260 × 95 px, positioned 120 px from the left border and 60 px from the top. 2. “Key-Conv” – identical appearance, 70 px to the right of Query-Conv. 3. “Value-Conv” – lavender fill, vertical orientation (95 × 260 px), positioned 555 px from left border, aligned top with others. 4. “Aux-Conv” – lavender fill (#baa7ff), 170 × 95 px, placed 30 px right of Value-Conv, aligned at top row.  Each convolution module has its own vertical input arrow entering from Block-A’s top border. Underneath each, a tensor icon is presented: - Below Query-Conv: tan square grid tensor (110 × 110 px), 125 px beneath. - Below Key-Conv: periwinkle tensor, horizontally aligned with tan icon. - Below Value-Conv: turquoise tensor (110 × 110 px), same vertical alignment. - Below Aux-Conv: pale-yellow tensor (110 × 110 px), dimension text “H×C×T” flush left.  The tan and periwinkle tensor icons have arrows converging into a cyan dot-product node (circle, 60 px diameter, solid black dot centre). Its downward arrow leads to a sky-blue module box “Similarity calculation” (300 × 90 px). The output flows to a green gradient tensor icon labelled “H×W×T”, which then arrows right into a vertical salmon-pink module “Variance activation” (95 × 260 px; text rotated 90°).  The turquoise tensor beneath Value-Conv feeds downward to a cyan multiply-circle node. Simultaneously, an arrow from the salmon-pink module also enters the same multiply-circle from the left. The pale-yellow tensor from Aux-Conv connects via a rightward arrow into a cyan plus-circle (positioned 670 px right border, y ≈ 725 px), forming an auxiliary skip connection. An upward diagonal arrow (35°) from the multiply-circle reaches a plus-circle along the right border (x = 910 px, centre-height). The plus-circle’s rightward arrow passes into the right section.  Block-B (right section, 615 px wide, 875 px tall) is organized into three parallel aggregation branches.  At entry, the Block-A output arrow directly enters a beige tensor icon (190 × 90 px) labelled “W×C×H×T”, internally featuring 9 vertical violet stripes. Immediately rightward, three spatial module boxes (stacked vertically, 40 px separation): - Top: “Spatial Aggregation” (lavender, 255 × 90 px). - Middle: “Temporal Aggregation” (pale-cyan, 255 × 90 px). - Bottom: “Frequency Aggregation” (pale-orange, 255 × 90 px).  Each aggregation box branches downward into distinct convolution modules: - Under each, a “Conv, 1×1” box (salmon-pink, 225 × 80 px), separated by 40 px. The top “Conv, 1×1” connects to the plus-circle for aggregation; the middle modules merge into a multiply-circle; the bottom feeds into a dedicated summing node.  Leftward, a duplicate arrow from Block-A’s entry travels down the interior of Block-B’s left edge to a lilac tensor icon (190 × 90 px) labelled “H×C×T×W”, with 9 horizontal gradient bars (top peach to deep orange bottom). From here, a rightward arrow reaches a purple “Spatial Aggregation” box (identical style), which leads into the bottommost “Conv, 1×1”. Output from this path merges with the central summing node.  Far right, all aggregation paths merge into a cyan multiply-circle (3 px black stroke), located 120 px from Block-B’s right border, near centre height. Above, a shortcut arrow falls vertically from Block-B’s top-right corner into this same multiply-circle (residual). The multiply-circle’s output enters a vertical steel-blue rounded rectangle (“Depth-wise Conv Block”, 95 × 345 px), centred 40 px from Block-B’s right border. Below, an output arrow exits this block, rounds left along the Block-B border, rises to close a residual loop into a plus-circle at Block-B’s top-right perimeter.  Between branches, the summing and multiplication circles display their respective “+” and “×” glyphs in black, 26 pt bold, centred on the cyan background. All data-flow arrows are solid black, 3 px thick, heads filled black, 45° tail cuts. Module labels use 24 pt Times New Roman bold, black and centrally aligned, spanning two lines where needed. Dimension annotations are italic serif, 20 pt, flush left to respective tensors. Tensor icons feature a 6 × 6 grid of tiny squares with consistent pastel fills.  Outside Block-B’s lower-right corner, the caption “DCTAM++” appears in bold, 32 pt Times-style, black font.  All modules, tensors, operator circles, and connections are spaced with a consistent 40 px separation. All strokes are uniformly 3 px black, with no drop-shadows or gradients, apart from the gradient fills within tensor grids. The style is clean and flat, with no dashed lines or gradient strokes."

Audio Value and Fusion branches: – From the bottom-right corner of the Key-Conv block, a right-angled black poly-line (horizontal then vertical) leads into a tall vertical peach rectangle (100 × 220 px), centre (66 %, 45 %), labeled “Value-Fusion” (text rotated 90°, top→bottom). – From the bottom of Value-Fusion, a 35 px downward arrow enters a 4 × 4 cyan grid icon (#A2F3FF, 80 × 80 px), centre (66 %, 67 %), left-side labeled “T×H×W”. – Arrow continues downward (35 px) into a white circle (Ø34 px) with a black “–”, aligned with other minus circles.  Residual and feature fusion: – From bottom edge of Feature-Conv, a horizontal arrow (40 px) leads to a tall vertical lavender rectangle (100 × 220 px), centre (82 %, 45 %), labeled “ResLayer” (text rotated 90°, top→bottom). – From the base of ResLayer, a 35 px downward arrow enters a white circle (Ø34 px) with a black “+”, positioned x ≈ 84 %, y ≈ 74 %.  Output merging: – All “–” circles emit horizontal arrows converging into the “+” circle. – From the “+” circle, a short vertical arrow points directly downward, indicating the final fused feature output.  Styling: – All arrows are solid black, 2 px wide, filled triangular heads. – Every rectangle and circle has a slight inner shadow (10 % black, 4 px blur) for visual depth. – All modules, icons, and connection paths are clearly separated and easy to distinguish."

ti2i_image_caption_91="Canvas dimensions are approximately 1700 px by 1600 px, with a slightly wider than tall 1:1 ratio. The main composition is a symmetric hourglass schematic formed by two left and right slanted trapezoids meeting at a central narrow neck. All outlines of the figure and modules are drawn with a uniform medium-gray stroke, 3 px thickness. The top center title reads “(a) RD4AD” in bold black sans-serif font, size 60 pt.  On the left side, within the trapezoid, there are four evenly spaced, vertical rounded-rectangle encoder modules, each 170 px wide, 520 px tall, corner radius 25 px, filled in light-gray (#d9d9d9) and outlined in medium-gray, 2 px. From left to right, the modules are labeled, rotated 90° counterclockwise, center-aligned, with bold black sans-serif text: “Encoder 1”, “Encoder 2”, “Encoder 3”, “Encoder 4”. Three thin horizontal black bars traverse the top of the first three encoder modules, indicating memory links, converging to the neck module. Above these bars, italic math text “𝒪(1)” in black, size 46 pt, is placed. Between the second and third encoders, a thin vertical black line connects downwards to the bottom edge of the left trapezoid.  At the hourglass neck, a small vertical rounded rectangle is centered, 150 px wide, 300 px tall, corner radius 25 px, filled in medium-gray (#bfbfbf), outlined in dark-gray, 2 px. Centered inside is “Neck” in bold black sans-serif. A thick rightward solid black arrow, width 25 px, connects the middle of the neck’s right edge to the decoder region.  On the right, within the mirrored trapezoid, there are four vertical rounded-rectangle decoder modules, spaced and sized identically to the encoders, filled in light-green (#cfe9cf), outlined in dark-green, 2 px. From right to left, each module is labeled, rotated 270° clockwise, center-aligned in bold dark-green: “CNN-Decoder 1”, “CNN-Decoder 2”, “CNN-Decoder 3”, “CNN-Decoder 4”. Across the top edge of the decoder modules, three horizontal thin dark-green lines illustrate output channels.  Beneath the waist, at the bottom center, is a horizontally oriented pill-shaped rounded rectangle, 500 px wide, 120 px tall, corner radius 35 px, outlined in golden-yellow (#d5a100), 5 px, with no fill (transparent interior). Centered inside is bold black sans-serif text: “Anomaly Map”. Below this, a faint gold target symbol overlays: concentric gold circle and cross-hair, diameter 120 px, stroke 4 px.  From the mid-height of the outer left and right slanted edges of both trapezoids, a total of six thick solid golden-yellow arrows (stroke 6 px, arrowhead size 40 px), three on each side, converge diagonally downward to the anomaly map pill, visually indicating information flow. Each arrow begins at equal intervals on the slant and ends at a different section of the pill’s edge. No dashing on arrows.  To the immediate right of the anomaly map pill, vertically aligned, is a 6 × 6 square grid, overall size 170 px, drawn with thin gold grid lines. Within the grid, three distinct, soft radial green blobs (center peak dark-green, outer fading to transparent) are distributed in the top-left, center, and bottom-right squares to indicate multiple anomaly strengths.  Above the neck region, aligned horizontally, there are two small transparent circles, outlined in black, labeled in black sans-serif: “Skip Link A” and “Skip Link B”, connected by thin black solid curved arrows from the encoder region to the decoder modules, crossing the neck.

ti2i_image_caption_92="A square scientific diagram (1024 × 1024 px, white background) features a detailed, multi-module neural architecture. In the center-left, a left-leaning black trapezoid with a vertical left edge, rightward-slanting right edge, and a bottom edge sloping upward at approximately 10° contains five vertically-stacked, stair-stepped rounded rectangles labeled “Encoder 1” through “Encoder 5”; each encoder uses a light-grey fill (#d9d9d9), 2 pt black stroke, and 6 px corner radius, with each successive block appearing shorter and positioned slightly rightward for perspective. Black horizontal lines (2 pt) extend from the top-right corners of each encoder block, merging into a single thicker (3 pt) horizontal line, which connects to a central vertical rounded rectangle labeled “Neck”, also light-grey (#d9d9d9), 2 pt black stroke, 6 px corner radius; the “Neck” is 60% the height of an encoder and 40% of its height in width. A bold, solid black right-pointing arrow (3 pt, 60° filled head) exits from “Neck” to the right.  To the immediate right of “Neck” is a large rectangular outline (3 pt black stroke, no fill) representing the transformer section. Inside this outline, three equally sized, vertically aligned rounded rectangles (white fill, 3 pt purple #b49ad0 stroke, 6 px corner radius) are labeled from left to right: “Transformer Encoder”, “Transformer Bottleneck”, “Transformer Decoder”, each label centered and set in black sans-serif font. Above the transformer block, slightly right of center, stands the italicized complexity term “𝒪(N² + N·M)” in dark grey (#4a4a4a), 24 pt font.  Beneath the transformer block, a solid yellow-orange (#f2c94c) double-headed horizontal arrow (stroke 2 pt, arrow heads at both ends, 60° filled) runs across, pointing both left and right. Centered directly above this arrow, a white-filled, transparent rounded rectangle (2 pt orange-brown #c98b2e stroke, 6 px corner radius) encloses the bold, black label “Anomaly Map” in 24 pt sans-serif font.  Directly below, a two-row horizontal bar band spans the entire canvas width, 60 px in height. The top row is light grey (#eeeeee) with centered, dark-grey “Global” text, and the lower row is slightly darker (#e0e0e0) labeled “Single-Scale”; all labels in 22 pt sans-serif font, vertically and horizontally centered in their bands. On the right half of this band, a 9 × 9 square grid (thin #cccccc lines) appears, with central cells forming a gaussian green blob: the center cell filled #3fa44a, immediate neighbours lighter (#7bc47f), outer cells nearly white, all remaining cells white. Superimposed on the left side of this grid is a small white rounded rectangle outlined with green (#3fa44a, 2 pt stroke, 6 px corner radius), labeled “ROI” in bold, black font (20 pt), partially overlapping the grid but not obscuring its contents. The grid sits behind the bar labels so “Global” and “Single-Scale” remain fully readable.  Above the encoder funnel, flushed right, the main title “(b) UniAD++” appears in 30 pt bold, dark-grey (#4a4a4a) sans-serif font. All arrows are solid black or solid yellow-orange (no dashed lines, no gradients). Visual alignment and spacing between modules is consistent throughout; colors are high-contrast and suitable for print publication."
ti2i_image_caption_93="The image depicts a high-resolution vector schematic with a scientific layout on a white canvas of aspect ratio approximately 1.1:1 (width to height). At the top center, the caption “(c) MambaAD” is shown in 24 pt bold black Helvetica Neue, with the calligraphic formula “𝒪(N)” in 20 pt italic immediately to its right.  Centralized horizontally is a complex hourglass or U-Net structure. On the left, a light-gray wedge (50% opacity, outlined dark gray) contains four vertically stacked encoder modules. Each encoder is a rounded rectangle with 6 pt corner radius, filled #d9d9d9, and aligned top to bottom with even gaps of 6 pt. “Encoder 1” is the tallest at 80% wedge height, followed by “Encoder 2”, “Encoder 3”, and “Encoder 4”, each 6% shorter in succession. Each encoder displays centered vertical text (rotated 90° clockwise, 18 pt) with the respective labels. Three horizontal black lines (3 pt) originate from the tops of Encoders 1–3, connecting to the neck; a fourth horizontal line from Encoder 4 runs to an auxiliary block above the neck.  At the lower tip of the left wedge is a large filled gold arrow (#d4a632) pointing toward the center, overlapping the wedge outline.  At canvas center is a “Neck” module: a vertical rounded rectangle, fill #bfbfbf, 2 pt outline #666, height 30% of encoder stack. The label “Neck” appears in centered text (16 pt). An attached small auxiliary block (“Multi-Context”) sits above the neck, also a rounded rectangle with fill #e2e2f7, labeled in 14 pt italic purple.  From the center neck, a solid black arrow (4 pt, filled arrowhead) points right toward the decoder wedge. A second black arrow also runs from the “Multi-Context” block toward the top decoder.  The right wedge, mirroring the left wedge in shape and style, contains four stacked decoder modules. Each decoder is a rounded rectangle with a top-to-bottom fill gradient: light-rose (#fde8e8) at top, soft pink (#f6cace) at bottom. Outlines alternate between deep-red #9e3030 and deep-purple #692c92, 2 pt wide. “Mamba-Decoder 1” is the tallest, followed by “Mamba-Decoder 2”, “Mamba-Decoder 3”, and “Mamba-Decoder 4”, each decreasing by 6% height downward. Vertical text labels (rotated 90° clockwise, 18 pt bold) in #590000 are centered within each rectangle.  A large gold arrow, identical to the left, emerges from the bottom tip of the right wedge toward the center.  At the center-bottom region lies a circular gold crosshair (outer diameter 7% of canvas width, stroke 3 pt) aligned exactly between two parallel solid horizontal gold lines (3 pt), stretching across the canvas and touching the arrowheads from both wedges.  Directly below the crosshair is the Anomaly Map module: a horizontal rounded rectangle, width 30% canvas, height 9% encoder stack, filled pale-gold (#fff3cf), 2 pt gold outline. Centered bold black text, 20 pt, displays “Anomaly Map”.  To the immediate right of the Anomaly Map box is an enhanced data visualization area. The top section contains a 6×6 square pixel grid (total side ~10% canvas), each cell separated by 1 pt white gap. Every cell is filled with a green scale from #e7ffe7 to #85d485, with a faint radial shading for subtle highlight. Above this grid is a smaller horizontal 3×3 grid (width 40% of the large grid) representing a zoomed local anomaly patch; each cell is deep green #6fa869, outlined 1 pt gray, making it visually distinct.  Above these grids, a legend bar spans the full combined width: a horizontal rounded rectangle (height 12 pt) filled #f1fff1 with thin 1 pt gray outline and labeled “Score” at left in 13 pt green.  Beneath the Anomaly Map module and grids, two horizontal stripes are centered, each spanning canvas width (height 8% encoder stack, no border). The first stripe presents “Global + Local” in 28 pt, heavy bright-red (#ff0000), all caps. The second stripe immediately below repeats the style for “Multi-Scale”.  Connecting the lower regions, four gold solid arrows (4 pt width, filled triangular tips) cross horizontally from the bottom left arrowhead, through the crosshair, Anomaly Map, and grids, terminating at the bottom right arrowhead. Two additional thinner arrows (2 pt, solid gold, no dash) curve upward, linking the anomaly grids to the top decoder and encoder modules, signifying backward relationships.  All elements are precisely aligned and spaced, maintaining a clean IEEE/ACM figure style, with consistent Helvetica Neue font, rounded shapes, and live editable text grouped by logical layers (encoders, decoders, neck, auxiliary blocks, arrows, anomaly map, pixel grid, legend, bottom tags, background)."
ti2i_image_caption_94="A vertical A4 scientific diagram on a white background. At the top, a banner spans the full canvas width (18 mm high), divided left into a 15 mm wide mid-grey (#BDBDBD) rectangle with centered bold white “(b)”, and right into pale-grey (#E6E6E6) with centered bold black “Inference Stage”. Below, horizontally centered and aligned in a row, three prompt rectangles appear, each 31 mm × 8 mm with four inner vertical cells.  On the left, a pale-orange (#F7C9A5) rectangle, labeled above with 8 pt italic red text “parallel prompt”. In the center, a pastel-green (#A5F7BD) rectangle, labeled above in 8 pt italic deep-blue “auxiliary prompt”. On the right, a pastel-blue (#A8C6FF) rectangle, labeled above in 8 pt italic black 'tuned prompt'. Each rectangle is evenly spaced horizontally, with 20 mm gaps between adjacent rectangles.  From the bottom of each prompt rectangle, downward 1 pt black arrows converge onto the top corners and center of a central isosceles trapezoid (“weight funnel”) positioned below, apex pointing down. The funnel measures 38 mm across the top, 24 mm across the base, 16 mm tall, filled pale-cyan (#C2E4FF), outlined black.  Inside the funnel, centered bold black text reads 'Weight' (9 pt) above Greek lowercase omega (11 pt bold). Along the left slant, 8 pt italic red text “0 < ω_b < 1”, rotated –25°. Along the right slant, 8 pt italic deep-blue text “ω_n → 0”, rotated +25°. Along the center axis just below the omega, a third annotation in 8 pt italic green positioned vertically: 'ω_a ≈ 0.5'.  From the funnel’s base, three black downward arrows, spaced evenly, extend to three vertically aligned modules below.  Each module is a rectangle, 52 mm × 70 mm, with a 6 mm gap between modules. The left is filled very-pale-peach (#FBE8DF), the center very-pale-green (#E0FBEB), the right very-pale-blue (#DDEBFF). Under each, centered bold labels are “Base” (9 pt, pale-orange #D87F3E), “Auxiliary” (9 pt, bold green #20B645), and “New” (9 pt, bold deep-blue #0066CC).  Inside each module, at 4 mm below the top, a prompt rectangle (31 mm × 8 mm, four vertical divisions) is centered. Left module: fill pale-yellow (#FFFBD1), outline black, underlabel “mixed prompt” (bold black 'mixed', normal 'prompt'). Center module: fill pastel-green (#A5F7BD), underlabel “aux prompt” (bold black 'aux', normal 'prompt'). Right module: fill pastel-blue (#A8C6FF), underlabel “origin prompt” (bold black 'origin', normal 'prompt').  From each prompt triangle’s center base, a black downward arrow (12 mm) leads to a large shared backbone rectangle spanning the three modules (total width 164 mm, height 9 mm, fill white, outlined black). Centered bold label “Prompt Learner Backbone” in 9 pt.  From the center bottom edge of the backbone, three symmetric black arrows (length 10 mm) point downward into each module. Arrow tips serve as baselines for labels: left module (“classification head” in 9 pt bold deep-blue, centered), center module (“contrast head” in 9 pt bold green #20B645, centered), right module (no label).  Under the three modules, a wide red (#D5211C) bracket (U-shaped) hugs the bottom edges, 2 mm outside outlines, horizontal member linking all three. Centered below, 9 pt italic red text “decoupled” beneath the bracket’s horizontal line.  All arrows, rectangles, labels, and modules are symmetrically distributed and aligned to maintain clear separation and organization."

ti2i_image_caption_100="The illustration is a high-fidelity scientific vector diagram with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a white background (canvas approximately 1920 × 900 px), comprised of two main horizontal blocks: Block I (“Universal Speech and Audio Distillation (USAD)”) occupies the lower-left two-thirds, and Block II (“Downstream Tasks”) occupies the lower-right third.  BLOCK I – UNIVERSAL SPEECH AND AUDIO DISTILLATION (USAD)  At the bottom left, four light-gray 3D cylinders (180 × 90 px each, horizontal alignment, 30 px gaps) represent data buckets, labeled inside with bold, black, 24 pt text: “Speech”, “Sound”, “Music”, and “Environmental Noise”. The “Environmental Noise” bucket is rightmost. Above each cylinder, solid black arrows (3 px thick) rise vertically 120 px, then each bends right at a 90° angle to feed into corresponding teacher networks.  A thick black curved arrow (3 px) arcs from all four cylinders to a fifth central cylinder labeled “Mixed Data” (same style, 180 × 90 px, positioned directly below the student network); a straight upward black arrow emerges from its center top, passing through an embedded tiny black audio waveform silhouette (150 px long) before ending in a small filled black circle at the bottom edge of the Student Network.  At upper left, three solid rounded rectangles (corner radius 20 px, stroke 3 px) form Teacher Networks; each is ≈400 px × 500 px. The leftmost is bordered and filled in light blue (#9CC3E5), middle in light green (#C6E0B4), and rightmost in light orange (#FFD9B3). Each teacher is titled top left inside (“Teacher 1”, “Teacher 2”, “Teacher 3”) in their respective colors, 26 pt, bold.  Within each teacher, from bottom to top: a rounded rectangle labeled “Layer 1” (same fill as border color, 90% opacity, 1 px black outline, 320 × 60 px, centered), an ellipsis (three vertically stacked black dots), a mid rectangle labeled “Layer l (Tⁱ)” where i = 1, 2, or 3 (same fill, 320 × 60 px), and on top, a horizontal row of 8 vertical capsules (50 × 80 px, 12 px gaps, matching their teacher color).  To the right, the Student Network is a solid pale yellow (#FFE699) rounded rectangle (400 × 500 px, stroke 2 px black, margin 140 px from Teacher 3), titled “Student” in dark yellow-brown (#C49A00), 26 pt, bold, top left inside. Inside: bottom rectangle “Layer 1” (pale yellow, 90% opacity), vertical ellipsis, mid rectangle “Layer l (S)”, top row of 8 yellow capsules.  Above the capsules of each teacher, a black curved arrow (3 px) arcs upward and right into a small rounded square (30 × 30 px) filled with the teacher’s color (blue, green, orange respectively, no outline). Each square connects via a short black arrow to a respective gray rounded rectangle labeled “MLP” (fill #CCCCCC, 120 × 60 px, 18 pt Arial, centered). From each MLP, a black arrow curves downward into the top capsules of the Student Network. Above these arrows, a centered caption in black bold italic, 24 pt: “Frame-wise L1 & Cosine Similarity Loss  ℒ”.  BLOCK II – DOWNSTREAM TASKS  Right of the Student, a square rounded rectangle labeled “USAD Model” (280 × 280 px, filled pale yellow #FFE699, stroke 2 px black); centered inside is “USAD Model” (dark yellow-brown, 28 pt, bold).  From the right edge of Student mid-height, a solid black arrow (3 px, no dash) runs horizontally to the left edge of the USAD Model box, with “Initialize” (20 pt, black) labeled above the arrow.  Above the USAD Model, three large light-gray (#F2F2F2) rounded rectangles (340 × 140 px, stroke 1 px #BFBFBF) indicate task categories, horizontally aligned with 40 px gaps. Leftmost contains: “Speech Tasks\n(ASR, Speaker ID, Keyword Spotting, Emotion Recognition)” in dark gray (#4C4C4C), 22 pt, centered; middle: “Audio Tasks\n(Audio Tagging, Sound Classification, Acoustic Scene Analysis)” in the same style; rightmost: “Music Tasks\n(Genre Identification, Beat Tracking)” (identical style).  Two solid black curved arrows (3 px) indicate outputs: one arcs from the top center of USAD Model up and right to the left Speech Tasks box; another arcs from USAD Model’s right edge up and left to the middle Audio Tasks box; a third arrow goes from top right corner up to the rightmost Music Tasks box.  Below the USAD Model box, four evenly spaced vector icons (120 px gaps) show downstream examples. Icons (drawn with thin black outlines, flat colors): (1) human bust (green shirt) speaking with a cyan speech bubble (three black dots); (2) cartoon dog (golden) facing right, cyan sound-wave glyph above open mouth; (3) classical guitar (brown body, dark neck) leaning right, two purple eighth-notes; (4) old-fashioned radio (gray body, red antenna, black speaker grille), blue signal lines above.  From each icon, a thin black (2 px) curved arrow rises to the base of the USAD Model, indicating example input paths.  GENERAL STYLING  All arrows use solid black strokes, 3 px, 45° arrowheads. All text except block captions is Arial sans-serif; captions use Times-like serif. Flat colors only, no gradients or drop shadows. Network rectangles (all Teachers and Student) are horizontally aligned. Equal white margins (≥60 px) frame the full canvas."
ti2i_image_caption_101="A rectangular canvas with a 5:4 aspect ratio (908 × 720 px) and a white background. The image is enclosed by a rounded rectangle frame (corner radius 12 px, 3 px stroke, color #2E3A5A), leaving a 30 px margin on all sides. In the top-right inside the frame, the bold black label “SAM4D++” (font size 34 px) is placed.  At the top edge, four black vertical arrows (3 px stroke, triangular heads, 40° tip, 12 px length) enter from outside the frame, spaced left to right: - On the left, the first arrow points to the top edge of a large pale-yellow rectangle (label above: “Prompt”, 24 px, bold).  - To its right, the second arrow points to the top edge of a light green trapezoid (label above: “Videos”, 24 px, bold). - Next, a third arrow points to the top edge of a light blue trapezoid (label above: “LiDAR Streams”, 24 px, bold). - Further right, a fourth arrow points to a pale violet trapezoid (label above: “Radar Streams”, 24 px, bold).  Beneath each input arrow, modules are arranged as follows:  Prompt Encoder module: pale-yellow rectangle (150 × 85 px, fill #FFF2CC, 2 px stroke #606060, 8 px radius), located in the upper left quadrant.

Centered bold text: “Radar Encoder” (22 px).  Below the encoders and Prompt Encoder, a thin, wide concave upward chevron (or horizontal bar), gray (#9A9A9A, 3 px stroke), labeled “UMPE” (centered, 18 px, bold). Four gray connector lines (3 px width) converge down from the bottom centers of Prompt Encoder, Image Encoder, LiDAR Encoder, and Radar Encoder to the UMPE bar.  Directly below UMPE and centered horizontally is the MCMA module: a pale peach rounded rectangle (230 × 105 px, fill #F8E0D5, stroke #606060, 8 px corner). Centered bold black text: “MCMA” (28 px).  To the right of MCMA (60 px gap), at the same vertical level, is the Memory Bank: a light pastel pink rectangle (150 × 90 px, fill #F7D4D9, stroke #606060, 8 px radius). Centered bold text: “Memory Bank” (22 px).  A gray horizontal connector line (3 px, #9A9A9A) goes from the right center of MCMA to the left center of Memory Bank. Another vertical gray connector line descends from the bottom center of Memory Bank to below.  Beneath MCMA, two parallel output modules are placed:  - Mask Decoder: a large light orange rectangle (220 × 95 px, fill #EABE8C, stroke #606060, 8 px corner), directly below MCMA (45 px vertical gap), with centered bold text: “Mask Decoder” (24 px). - Attention Fusion Head: to the right and slightly below Memory Bank (45 px below, same vertical as Mask Decoder), a pastel cyan rectangle (120 × 85 px, fill #C7F7F4, stroke #606060, 8 px corner), labeled “Attention Fusion Head” (18 px, bold, centered).  A vertical gray connector line (3 px) connects MCMA’s bottom center to the top center of Mask Decoder.  A vertical gray connector from the bottom center of Memory Bank divides in two: - One branch continues straight down, connecting to the left side of Mask Decoder. - Another branch slopes right and down, connecting into the top of the Attention Fusion Head.  A horizontal gray connector line joins the right side of Mask Decoder to the left of the Attention Fusion Head.  A gray vertical line also descends from the bottom center of Prompt Encoder, bending horizontally to join the left edge of Mask Decoder.  From the bottom center of Mask Decoder, a thick, vertical black arrow exits the outer frame downwards. From the bottom center of Attention Fusion Head, a parallel black arrow also exits the frame downwards.  Beneath the frame, two output captions are centered horizontally. The left caption (below Mask Decoder arrow): “Valid Object Mask on each camera and LiDAR frame” (24 px, bold, black). The right caption (below Attention Fusion Head arrow): “Attention-based Fusion Output” (24 px, bold, black).  All modules use 2 px mid-gray (#606060) strokes with 8 px corner radii. All shapes use low-saturation, pastel-colored fills. All text uses a clean sans-serif font (Helvetica/Arial), bold for module titles. Vertical gaps between modules are uniform (~45 px). All arrowheads are 12 px in length. All elements are crisp and publication-ready at 300 dpi."

'Action' (sage-green #C9DCC4)    Beneath 'Caption,' a vertical stack is arranged, left-aligned:   • 'Clip & MLLM' (sky-blue #B9DAF7, 110 × 38 px), arrow downward   • 'MLP' (sky-blue, 70 × 34 px), arrow to Add node below   • Add node ('＋' circle, 26 px, white fill, gray 2 px stroke, black plus), arrow downward   • 'MLP' (sky-blue, 70 × 34 px), arrow downward to next component  Leftmost, a salmon 'Timestep' module (80 × 30 px) feeds a blue 'Sinusoidal Encoding' box (120 × 34 px) via a rightward arrow, which then connects to the lower MLP via an upward/right dashed line intersecting at the Add node.  Beside the vertical stack, two additional modules are placed:   • 'Attention Adapter' (sky-blue #B9DAF7, 90 × 34 px), right of the 'MLP' stack, arrow to the main transformer region   • 'Cross-Modal Fusion' (lavender #D8CFF5, 90 × 30 px), right of 'Attention Adapter,' arrow feeding into transformer stack below    Under 'Image/Video,' the vertical branch flows:   • '3DVAE' (sky-blue, 110 × 38 px), arrow down   • 'Denoising Head' (gray #DDDDDD, 80 × 30 px), arrow down   • Add node ('＋' circle), arrow down   • 'Patchify' (gray, 100 × 34 px), arrow feeding horizontally into Concat node below    Under 'Noisy Input,' an arrow drops into:   • 'Noise Sampler' (gray #DDDDDD, 90 × 30 px), arrow into same Add node as above   • Output of Add node proceeds to 'Patchify' module (gray, 100 × 34 px)  Under 'Mask,' arrow into:   • 'Mask Processor' (gray #DDDDDD, 90 × 30 px), arrow into same 'Patchify' module as above    Under 'Action,' arrow into:   • 'Action Encoder' (sky-blue #B9DAF7, 120 × 38 px), arrow into 'Action Aggregator' (gray, 90 × 30 px), arrow into 'Patchify' (gray, 100 × 34 px) right of the first Patchify module  The two Patchify modules output to a central '⊕' Concat circle, placed beneath them (one arrow from each Patchify to Concat). Below the Concat node, a single downward arrow leads into the main transformer block.  The main transformer region, centered on the page (330 × 120 px), is a lavender (#D8CFF5) rounded rectangle containing three stacked internal rounded rectangles (width-matched, separated by 6 px gaps):   • Top: 'Triple Stream DiT Blocks'   • Middle: 'Double Stream DiT Blocks'   • Bottom: 'Single Stream DiT Blocks'   Each has a descriptive label in black, centered.  To the left within the main transformer region, a small rounded rectangle labeled 'Auxiliary Attention' (sky-blue, 80 × 28 px) receives a left-pointing arrow from 'Cross-Modal Fusion.'   To the right, a small rounded rectangle labeled 'Context Mixer' (sky-blue, 80 × 28 px) is connected with rightward arrows from all three stream blocks.  From the bottom of the transformer region, a downward arrow leads to a gray 'UnPatchify' module (100 × 34 px), then to a salmon 'Output' module (100 × 34 px) centered near the canvas base.  Below Output, a final trio of modules are aligned horizontally with short arrows:   • 'Loss Function' (gray, 90 × 28 px) left   • 'Evaluation Metric' (gray, 90 × 28 px) center   • 'Postprocessing' (gray, 90 × 28 px) right    In the lower-right within the border, a compact legend displays three operator nodes (inline):   ⊕ Concat ＋ Add △ Conditional Select   Each shown as appropriately styled operator circles with short labels (font 9-pt).  Spacing is precise: vertical gaps between modules 20 px, horizontal gap between Patchify modules 80 px, headers sit 50 px above first blue modules, and all arrows are solid medium-gray 2 px lines with filled triangular heads.  All modules and connection shapes are crisply defined, with flat pastel fills, sans-serif centered black text (11-pt for modules, 9-pt for legend), no gradients or shadows. Layout must ensure logical left-to-right and top-to-bottom reading flow, with no arrows crossing. The palette includes salmon (#F8B7B7), sky-blue (#B9DAF7), sage-green (#C9DCC4), lavender (#D8CFF5), gray module (#DDDDDD), border gray (#A0A0A0), arrow/stroke gray (#707070), text black."

ti2i_image_caption_105="A wide, horizontally oriented scientific diagram is presented on a pure white background. The entire content is enclosed within a thick, solid black rectangle with rounded corners and a 2 pt stroke. A central vertical solid black line divides the canvas into equal left and right halves. The plus symbol “+”, in bold 24 pt sans-serif, is precisely centered at the bottom border, separating two italicized black captions: “Step-level reward” (left) and “Trajectory-level reward” (right), both in 18 pt.  At the top left, the main title “Reward Design” appears in bold, black, 36 pt sans-serif, left-aligned.  Left Half: Step-Level Reward  This half is structured in three distinct horizontal layers, each representing a different reward type.  Top Layer – Quality Reward: A bold 24 pt black heading “Quality Reward” sits flush left at the start of this layer. To its right, five evenly spaced, horizontal salmon (#e39a6f) rounded rectangles (each 80 × 36 px, no border) are arrayed left to right. Each is labeled “Step 1”, “Step 2”, “Step 3”, “Step 4”, “Step 5” in 14 pt black, centered. A solid black arrow from each step converges toward a single “Expert LLM” icon positioned rightmost on this row. Above the convergence arrow, the italic word “Judge” (14 pt) hovers. The “Expert LLM” icon depicts a flat-design scientist in a blue-lined white coat and sky-blue pants, with neutral gray hair and a yellow light-bulb held in the right hand, sized 60 × 60 px.  Middle Layer – Coherence Reward: A bold 24 pt black heading “Coherence Reward” introduces this row at left. To the right, six salmon rounded rectangles (same size as above), labeled “Step 1” through “Step 6”, are positioned in a horizontal sequence, 16 px apart. From beneath each adjacent pair of steps, two angled solid black V-shaped arrows merge downward, forming five merging points that map to a single central node below, represented by a small black-filled circle.  Bottom Layer – Alignment Reward: A bold 24 pt black heading “Alignment Reward” is set at the leftmost edge of this row. This layer contains three vertical columns, each with three stacked rectangles. The upper row consists of three salmon rectangles labeled “Model Step 1”, “Model Step 2”, “Model Step 3”. Immediately below, three corresponding brick-red (#c75a63) rectangles labeled “Baseline 1”, “Baseline 2”, “Baseline 3”. Below these, three pastel green (#8fd3a9) rectangles labeled “Oracle 1”, “Oracle 2”, “Oracle 3”. Between each vertical triple, black bidirectional (double-headed) horizontal arrows link the three rectangles in each column for cross-comparison. Between each model step, solid right-pointing arrows (black) indicate forward progression.  Right Half: Trajectory-Level Reward  Top Left: This half begins at top-left with a light gray (#d7d7d7) horizontal rounded rectangle (120 × 34 px) labeled “Question” in 14 pt black, centered. Directly below, three long, horizontally stacked rounded rectangles (each 220 × 34 px, 10 px vertical spacing): a salmon rectangle labeled “Thinking Trajectories”, a brick-red rectangle labeled “Final Model Response”, and a pastel green rectangle labeled “Reference Solution”.  Arrows and Icons: A thick, solid black horizontal arrow flows rightward from the rectangles' stack toward the “Expert LLM” icon (as described above). Above this arrow, in italic, is the word “Verify” (14 pt). Continuing right, another thick black arrow connects from the LLM icon to a “Guided Template” icon: a stylized newspaper/document with three small rectangles (cyan, orange, yellow) in the upper half, outlined in black, 48 × 60 px. To the right of this arrowhead is the italic phrase “Guided Template” (14 pt), vertically centered with the icon.  Downward, a thick black arrow runs from the bottom center of the “Guided Template” icon, bending downward and left at a right angle to a large theta symbol “θ” (bold, black, 36 pt), positioned centrally. Above the horizontal segment of this arrow is the italic word “Instruct”. Just beneath the theta symbol, the label “Policy Model” (centered, 14 pt black) is placed.  Policy Model and Responses: To the left of the Policy Model region, five horizontal pastel-colored capsule “response sticks” (red “1”, yellow “2”, blue “3”, green “4”, purple “5”), each with a small white number at the left tip, stacked vertically, 10 px apart. A solid right-pointing black arrow labeled “Generate” (italic, above arrow) extends from the response sticks to the Policy Model. A leftward black arrow labeled “Evaluate” (italic, below arrow) runs from the response sticks to a “Reward” icon: a clipboard with a green checkmark on top, outlined in black, 48 × 60 px.  Additional Annotations: At the top right corner, in bold 24 pt black font, the phrase “Meta-Reward Aggregation” is presented. Diagonally downward arrows (solid black) from the Policy Model region point toward both the Reward icon and the Reference Solution rectangle, each labeled “Compare” (italic, along arrow shafts).  Stylistic Notes: All connecting arrows are solid, pure black, of consistent thickness. All typography is sans-serif, with section headings bolded and internal labels regular unless italicized as specified. All colored rectangles and icons remain flat, with smooth rounded corners, no gradients or shadows. Elements are precisely aligned, with equal ~40 px margins inside the main dashed boundary.  This diagram presents a multi-tiered, comparative reward design system with increased complexity, multiple step and response modules, additional reference comparison, explicit meta-aggregation, and enhanced cross-module clarity."
ti2i_image_caption_106="The image is a high-resolution, landscape-oriented scientific infographic with a pure white (#FFFFFF) background. It contains two main horizontally aligned sub-figures, labeled (a) and (b), arranged side by side and separated by a 40 px horizontal gutter. At the very top, there are two long, light-gray (#E6E6E6) horizontal rounded rectangles (30 px tall) with soft, fully rounded 10 px corners, crisp 2 px black borders, and subtle 3 px drop shadows at 20% opacity. The left rectangle (425 px wide) is labeled “Video Generator” in bold, black, 14 pt sans-serif; the right rectangle (525 px wide) is labeled “Chunk-Wise Generative Model”.  Beneath each gray bar, a thick, straight vertical black arrow (3 px wide, 40 px tall) points upward toward its respective gray bar. The tails of these arrows are attached to the top edges of content panels below.  Sub-figure (a) on the left half consists of the following modules: - A beige condition panel (very pale peach, #FCE9D6, 420 px × 180 px) is flush left and contains:   - The title “Conditions” (black, 12 pt) anchored bottom-left inside the panel.   - Content arranged left-to-right:     - Five medium green (#59A654) upright rounded rectangles (32 px × 50 px, 2 px dark outline) evenly spaced, followed by a typographic black ellipsis. Centered below, “Language Tokens” in medium green, italic, 12 pt, with a downward-concave black curly brace (2 px stroke) tying all green rectangles together.     - A 25 px horizontal gap separates this section from the next: a single blue (#6FA4E6) rounded rectangle (32 px × 50 px), with the number “1” in white, bold, centered inside. A thin vertical black line connects this rectangle to its caption below: “Conditional Frame” (blue text, 12 pt).   - Directly beneath both these modules and spanning the panel’s width is a row of three icons: left—a small closed lock (black outline, 14 px), center—a yellow shield (filled, 14 px) with a black checkmark, right—a green eye (outline, 14 px).  To the right of the beige panel, without any gap, is the noisy-frames block for sub-figure (a): - A second condition panel (very pale peach, #FCE9D6, 420 px × 180 px) is placed, baseline aligned. Its contents:   - Top left-aligned: “Frames:” (black, 12 pt) followed by five blue rounded rectangles (32 px × 50 px) labeled “2, 3, 4, 5, …, N” (numbers in white, bold, centered).   - Beneath the frames, three parallel black plus signs (30 pt) arranged horizontally and spaced evenly.   - Below each plus sign, a cluster of five grey (#B3B3B3) rounded rectangles. The left-most cluster is diagonally hatched (45°, 4 px stroke, #8C8C8C, 50% opacity); the center cluster filled with small black dots; the right cluster with horizontal line pattern (4 px stroke, #8C8C8C, 40% opacity). Each cluster is grouped by a single black curly brace below, and each is labeled, respectively, “Noisy Frames”, “Random Dots”, “Structured Noise” (all slate-grey, italic, 12 pt).   - Superimposed in the bottom-right of this panel is a styled black gear icon (18 px).  Beneath both peach boxes, covering combined width is a caption: “(a) Video Generator” (black, italic, 12 pt, centered).  Sub-figure (b) on the right half includes: - A beige condition panel (very pale peach, #FCE9D6, 420 px × 180 px) placed right of (a), with a 40 px gutter.   - Title “Conditions” (black, 12 pt) anchored bottom-left.   - Content, left-to-right:     - Five medium-green rounded rectangles (as in a), with ellipsis, curly brace, and “Language Tokens” label.     - 25 px horizontal gap; “Frames:” (black, 12 pt), then four blue rounded rectangles labeled “1, 2, 3, 4” (white text); underneath, “Conditional Chunk” (blue, bold italic, 12 pt).     - Below the frames, two black plus signs (30 pt) stacked vertically. Left of the top plus: three vertically aligned hatched grey rectangles labeled “Noise Aug.” with curly brace and caption (slate-grey, 12 pt). Right of the bottom plus: three vertically aligned orange (#F7BE38) rectangles with upward-slanting hatch (4 px stroke, #DC8600, 60% opacity), grouped with curly brace and caption “Stochastic Perturbation” (orange italic, 12 pt).  - To the right, flush with previous beige box (no gap), of identical size, is a chunk panel:   - “Frames:” row: three blue rounded rectangles labeled “5, 6, 7”; below, single large plus sign; below, cluster of three grey diagonally-hatched rectangles with curly brace and “Noisy Frames” label (slate-grey, italic, 12 pt).   - Top-right corner contains a blue document icon (16 px).  - Further right, separated by a 30 px gap, a third condition panel (pale peach, same size) shows:   - Top: “Frames:” (black, 12 pt) and three purple (#A077C0) rounded rectangles labeled “8, 9, 10” (white text).   - Below, a horizontal plus sign, then cluster of three solid black rounded rectangles with curly brace and “Mask Tokens” label (purple italic, 12 pt).   - Center-bottom, a purple tag icon (14 px).  Beneath these three panels, centered, is the caption “(b) Chunk-Wise Generative Model” (black italic 12 pt).

Every panel and rectangle is shadowed with a subtle 3 px drop shadow (20% opacity, 0 px blur). All module icons are outlined and sized as specified. All graphical elements have flat colors, no gradients, and no dashed or gradient lines."
ti2i_image_caption_107="The infographic is horizontally aligned with a 2.1:1 canvas ratio and vivid white background. The style is playful and cartoonish, incorporating a pastel palette and clear vector shapes. Modules use rounded rectangles with a 12 px corner radius; all outlines are solid with a 2 px stroke, and elements cast soft 15% opacity black shadows with 4 px blur.  On the far left, a light-lavender vertical panel covers about 30% of the width. At the top center, the title “Caption Scaling” is rendered in medium-blue rounded sans-serif, flanked on the left by a balance scale icon and a closed book icon stacked vertically. Below the title is a compact chart on a white background: thin black axes, horizontal labeled “Number of Instr”, vertical labeled (rotated) “Detail Coverage”. A coral-pink exponential-saturation curve rises steeply and plateaus at the top right, intersected by a solid vertical black line at x = N, marked with a bold “N”. Below the chart, a steel-blue sub-panel features a minimalist white outline hand-pushing-slider icon. To the right, two lines of navy text: “Adjust N to trade off” and “the richness of image detail and cost”.  Extending from the middle right edge of the lavender panel, a thick angled salmon-pink chevron arrow leads into the main process area. Centered on the canvas are two vertically stacked process flows, separated by an 80 px gap, both beginning with the same cartoon llama mascot featuring light beige fur, black glasses, and pink ear interiors.  The upper (Object) path begins with the mascot left of a pale-yellow rounded rectangle titled “Golden Sentences” in bold dark khaki. Below, a vertically bracketed list of three orange-dashed rounded rectangles, each containing different grey placeholder text (“The race car is...”, “The headlights in...”, “The wheel spins...”). To the left of the bracket, a black curly brace annotated with deep pink “N”. A thick angled salmon-pink chevron arrow points right to a slim vertical peach-orange column headed “Rating and Filter” (handwritten-style black font, centered vertically). Right of this column, a cartoon robot-judge torso in a navy suit and crimson tie with a metallic cylindrical head, small horn antennae, holding a gavel in one hand and a clipboard in the other, is depicted. Above the robot-judge, a pale yellow lightbulb icon signifies evaluation. Another chevron arrow extends to a wide cream rectangle titled “Object Detail Summarization” in bold black casual font. Within the cream rectangle, three horizontal pale-khaki rounded modules display examples of brief object summaries in friendly bold text (“Compact color description”, “Complex feature list”, “Fine-grained shape assessment”).  The lower (Position) path mirrors the structure. The llama mascot introduces a pale-yellow “Golden Sentences” header. Below, a vertically bracketed list of three red-dashed rounded rectangles with positional placeholder text (“The position of...”, “The headlights are...”, “The rear spans...”), bracketed by a curly brace with deep pink “N”. A salmon-pink chevron arrow leads to a slim peach-orange vertical “Rating and Filter” column with the same font and layout. Beside it, another robot-judge holds a set of location pins and a pointing stick. Above, a mint-green map-pin icon. A chevron arrow leads to a wide light-mint rectangle titled “Position Detail Summarization” in bold black casual font, containing three horizontal pale-mint rounded modules displaying examples of positional details (“Precise coordinates”, “Relative topology”, “Layered spatial grouping”).  All connecting arrows are thick, creamy salmon-pink chevrons with 90° angled arrowhead, 24 px wide. The module sequence is clearly separated and visually balanced. Text throughout is a Nunito-style friendly rounded sans-serif. The overall composition is crisp and clear: no gradient fills, dashed lines, or blurred areas. Every module is carefully spaced with a harmonious layout and subtle drop shadows."
ti2i_image_caption_108="The canvas is divided vertically into two equal panels by a narrow white gap. The left panel is bounded by a rounded rectangle frame (4 px, pastel pink #F8E8E8), and the right by a similar frame in pastel blue (#E6EEFF, 4 px). Both panels have a white interior background and utilize a flat vector style with 2 px #4A4A4A outlines, friendly rounded “Nunito” font (varied sizes for headings, body, annotation), and pastel color accents.  **Left Panel**  Top-left features a heading: “Miss the details!” in italics, warm pastel pink (#F39EC4), hand-written style, with a yellow five-point spark (20 px diameter) accent partially behind “details!”. Below this, center-top, a 200×115 px rounded rectangle photo placeholder with a dark outline shows three stylized beige-brown waffles (with syrup stripes) arranged on a white plate with a faint gray shadow. A sky-blue magnifying glass (rim #4E9CEB, handle #F15A5A), tilted 20° right, overlaps the top-left of the photo.  Beneath the photo, a vertical bullet workflow starts. The first bullet is a gray rounded speech bubble (420×78 px, fill #DADADA) containing: “…there are several plates of” (black body text) and “food” (bold red-orange #F05A28). To the right edge of this bubble is a flushed yellow emoji (squiggly mouth, sweat drop). A thick curved yellow arrow (#FEC84D, 4 px) leads downward-right toward the second bullet. The second bullet is a white rounded rectangle (385×62 px, border #FEC84D, 2 px) with blue monospace text: “Generate simple question about food”. To its left is a cartoon man (80 px tall, skin #F5CBA7, brown hair, silver laptop, subtle shadow).  Another curved yellow arrow connects the second box to the third bullet below. The third bullet is a periwinkle rounded rectangle (495×72 px, fill #D6E3FF) stating: “Describe more details about” (black) and “the food” (bold deep blue #1D56CC, period trailing).  A fourth element in the series is a pink rounded speech bubble (530×165 px, fill #F9DDE1, left-aligned), containing: “The food on the table includes several pieces of what appears to be a type of bread or pastry, some of which appear to be topped with jam or butter.” (black text). At the bottom-right of the bubble is a white llama sticker (lavender shading, round glasses, smile). At bottom-left of the bubble is a yellow smiling face emoji (closed eyes, wide grin, slight shadow).   To the right of the workflow, there are three vertically stacked circular icons:  - Top: Red checkmark shield (40 px diameter). - Middle: Blue open book (40 px wide). - Bottom: Green clipboard (40 px wide). Each icon is encircled with a white border and faint gray shadow.  At the bottom-center of the panel is an annotation in small black text: “Early description often lacks key details.” A thin, curved coral arrow (#FFA977, 3 px) traces from the annotation upward to the waffles photo.  **Right Panel**  Top-center is the heading: “Statistical Results” (bold pastel lavender #7986CB, size ≈46 pt). Immediately below is an icon montage row: to the left, a 3×2 grid of six teal-green photo icons (50×50 px, each showing mountain/sky motif) labeled “100 imgs” (black 28 pt) beneath. A large black “+” (60 pt) separates icons from the right, where a rounded speech bubble (white, 260×65 px, border #8AAFFF) holds “Describe this image in detail.” (dark gray text). Below the bubble, a large downward blue arrow (#4E9CEB, 4 px stroke, 40 px arrowhead) points to a smiling llama head (glasses, lavender shading, 60 px tall).  Further down, a left-aligned stack of three document icons (each 55×70 px, outlined #4A4A4A, yellow dog-ear fold) is present.

ti2i_image_caption_110="A landscape-oriented infographic is displayed on a light-grey (#E8E8EE) canvas with a 16:9 aspect ratio. There are two horizontally stacked, large rounded rectangles as functional regions. The upper region has a lavender background (#D9D4E9), 6-px radius corners, and is outlined with a solid deep-violet (#3C2E64) 3-px line. The lower region shows a very-light peach (#F8E6D0) fill, same corner radius, and is bordered by a solid 3-px sienna-brown (#704428) stroke.  In the upper region, “Student Sentiment Analysis” is presented at the top left in a rounded rectangle tile (110×55 px, pale-lavender #CFCADD, black border) containing a vertical speech-bubble icon (35 px wide) with three stacked round emoji faces—happy (green #8BC34A), neutral (blue-cyan #4FC3F7), and sad (red #F44336), each with black outlines. To the right bottom within the tile is a black outline humanoid robot bust with a green LED. At the tile's far right, bold text reads “Student Sentiment Analysis”.  Below the title, aligning left, are three parallel horizontal white rectangles (each 35 px high × 220 px wide) with 18 px vertical gaps. The top bar reads “DT state observation”. Beneath it, an under-brace links to a horizontal bar with eight small white 32×32 px square cells, spaced by 5 px, labeled S₁, S₂, S₃, S₄, S₅, S₆, S₇, Sₙ (right-to-left order), each with a dark border. Below is “Conversation with Interactive Tutor (Text or Audio)” and below that is “Historical Student Contexts”, all in bold black sans-serif font.  To the right of these source rectangles is a tall vertical stack of eight white rectangles, each 100×36 px, 10 px vertical gap. Each rectangle is labeled “Seq₁” through “Seq₈” (top is “Seqₙ”). Vertical ellipsis dots appear in the fifth cell. From the right side of the stack, a broad midnight-blue (#1D4B8F) arrow exits and bends up at 90°, feeding into the bottom of the adjacent “Text Sequence” bar.  The adjacent “Text Sequence” bar is a white vertical rectangle (60×260 px), subdivided by thin black horizontal lines into eight equal-sized cells. Cells are labeled top to bottom as: T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6; cell six has vertical ellipsis, followed by Tn in the eighth cell. A bold caption “Text Sequence” is vertically left-aligned.  To the right, centered vertically at the bar’s middle, is a 90-px-diameter circle, split left/right with medium-blue (#1E75BB) and deep-indigo (#3F2D92). Inside is a pale-yellow (#FFF176) right-facing human side-profile silhouette. Across the circle, neon lime (#C6FF00) circuitry traces in geometric paths, intersecting nodes in triangular and square patterns. A hot-pink (#FF4081) “AI” pill label is at top-right. Above the circle, a white rounded rectangle (75×28 px, black border) holds bold uppercase “PROMPT”. Directly below the circle, another rounded rectangle (82×28 px, black border) displays “MODEL CONFIG” in bold.  Two thick midnight-blue arrows emerge from the right edge of the circle. The upper arrow immediately enters a tall 80×260 px light-mint-green rectangle with a solid black border, subdivided into seven equal internal white cells, with thin black outlines. The top six cells are labeled “Sentiment 1” through “Sentiment 6”, the seventh cell is double-height and labeled “Sentiment Vector Set”. The lower arrow connects into a similar adjacent mint-green panel labeled “Emotion Classifier Output” (six equal cells and a double-height seventh, labeled “Emotion Profile Vector”).  A third wide midnight-blue arrow arcs upward from the bottom center of the sentiment panel, curves right to upper center, and terminates at a 60×120 px pale-mint green box labeled “Sentiment Feedback” with a bold heading and a black-filled circle icon.  Midway along each arrow, small italic black captions denote “Data Transformation”, “Sentiment Information”, or “Classifier Update”.  In the lower region, at left is a decorative light-orange rectangle (150×60 px, black border) captioned “LLM Knowledge Enhancement” (centered, two lines). Within, a row of five pastel pictograms: pink (#FF80AB) bar chart, lavender gear, yellow (#FFEB3B) light-bulb, blue book icon, and a black outline brain.  Aligned below, a vertical stack of eight white rectangles (100×36 px, 10 px gaps) matches the upper sequence stack, with ellipsis in the fifth cell, labeled “Seq₁” through “Seq₈” (top to bottom). A thick midnight-blue arrow points right into a second “Text Sequence” bar at the center-top of the peach region (identical in style and size to above), with T1–T8 cell labels.  To the right, a 90-px-diameter circle (same color split, circuit traces, and silhouette) overlapped at lower-right by a white 50×35 px rounded square (black outline), inside a magnifying glass examining a black node-edge graph with red, blue, and violet nodes. Label beneath reads “Graph RAG”. A third white rounded rectangle below (82×28 px, black outline) holds bold “RAG CONFIG”.  Below the circle, bold caption reads “LLM with Graph RAG & External Reasoner”.  To the far right, a light-mint rectangle (80×260 px, black border), subdivided into six equal-height interior white cells labeled “Guidance 1” through “Guidance 6”, and a double-height seventh cell labeled “Knowledge Vector Set”. Adjacent right, a matching panel labeled “Interactive Knowledge Map” with six cells (“Node 1” to “Node 6”, last cell double-height, “Knowledge Map Vector”).  Thick midnight-blue arrows connect rightward from the AI icon’s right edge to both knowledge-vector panels, and a curved upward arrow connects the lower “Knowledge Vector Set” to the upper region’s “Emotion Profile Vector” panel.  All major rectangles, circles, and bars have a 5 px mild drop-shadow (20% opacity black) for depth. Horizontal alignment ensures all mint-green panels are vertically flush. All arrows are straight and right-angle elbows, 6 px wide. All font and borders are pure black, emoji outlines are black. Gradients and dashed lines are absent."

ti2i_image_caption_116="On a horizontally oriented canvas with a white background, two distinct vertical regions are present: the left region represents the Encoder and Predictor, and the right region represents the Decoder. Each region is enclosed by a separate rounded rectangle (corner radius: 6 pt, outline: 1 pt #333333), filled with a light warm-gray color (RGB 255,250,240), with a narrow white gutter separating them.  Above the left region, centered, is a bright-blue (#2288E8) rounded rectangle (72 × 35 px) with a white loudspeaker glyph, labeled “Audio” in bold, 9 pt, black font beneath it. Above the right region, centered, is another bright-blue (72 × 35 px) rounded rectangle with a white document glyph, labeled “Text” in bold, 9 pt, black font beneath it.  Within the left region (Encoder + Predictor):  At the top, 20 px below the Audio icon, is a 140 × 45 px neutral light gray (#E8E8E8) rounded rectangle labeled “Preprocess.”  Below Preprocess, a vertical encoder stack is present. To the left of the stack, a thin vertical bracket (1 pt black line, height 180 px) with “× L” (8 pt italic) at its center indicates stacking. Inside the stack, three blocks are vertically aligned and slightly spaced: - Top: 140 × 45 px light sky-blue (#B8D4FF) block labeled “MSA layer.” - Middle: 10 px below, a light spring-green (#C7F0C7) block labeled “FF layer.” - Bottom: 10 px below, another light sky-blue (#B8D4FF) block labeled “Conv layer.” Between each adjacent pair of blocks, a 12 px white circle with black outline and a black “⊕” symbol indicates residual connection points. A black vertical arrow connects Preprocess to the top of the first block. Black arrows descend through each “⊕” circle to the next block, exiting downward from the last circle.  Below the encoder stack, a 10 px gap precedes a light-yellow (#FFF3A8) “⊕” circle (12 px).  Predictor module (enclosed in a slightly darker warm-gray (#FDF6EF) rounded rectangle, 160 × 290 px, outlined in #333333) is positioned below. Inside the module (top to bottom, 15 px vertical gaps): 1. At the top-center, a light sky-blue (#B8D4FF) block labeled “Conv layer.” 2. Below, a light spring-green (#C7F0C7) block labeled “Linear.” 3. Below Linear, an apricot-orange (#FFD9A5) block labeled “Sigmoid.” 4. Right of Linear, a tall vertical light-yellow (#FFF3A8) block (140 × 90 px) labeled “CIF.” 5. Right of CIF, a medium vertical pale maize yellow (#FFF3A8) block (90 × 60 px) labeled “Gating Norm.” Black arrows connect Conv layer down to Linear, then Linear to Sigmoid, and Linear (diagonal right) to CIF. From the bottom of Sigmoid, a dashed black arrow (2 pt dash) goes diagonally up-right, merging into the left edge of CIF. From the right edge of Sigmoid, a solid black arrow connects directly to Gating Norm. From the right edge of Gating Norm, a solid black arrow connects to the bottom of CIF. From the right edge of CIF, a long horizontal black arrow (~120 px) exits the Predictor module, crossing the gutter into the Decoder region.  At the lower left, outside the Predictor enclosure, is a bold “Predictor” label (8 pt, dark gray).  Within the right region (Decoder):  The incoming arrow from CIF connects to the top-center of a spring-green (#C7F0C7) block labeled “FF layer” (140 × 45 px). Directly below is a light-yellow (#FFF3A8) block labeled “Norm & Add.” A slim elbow arrow (black, 1 pt) emerges from the right side of FF layer, bends downward, and enters Norm & Add. Below is a light pastel-red (#FFCDD2) block labeled “FSMN.” Below FSMN, a light-yellow Norm & Add block. A right elbow residual connection from the left edge of FSMN feeds into this lower Norm & Add block.  Below this, two apricot-orange (#FFD9A5) blocks labeled “MHA” are side-by-side, each 115 × 45 px, 30 px apart. Central down arrow from the upper Norm & Add splits into two, feeding both MHA blocks. Back-residual arrows (black, 1 pt) curve from the right edges of both MHA blocks, bend inward/down, and merge into the next block.  Beneath the MHA blocks, a lavender (#E5D5F6) block (span ≈260 px, height 45 px), labeled “Concat.” Two vertical arrows, one from each MHA, descend into Concat.  Below Concat, a light-yellow (#FFF3A8) block labeled “Norm & Add.” A slim back-residual arrow loops from Concat’s right edge down and into the left edge of this Norm & Add block.  Below, a light spring-green (#C7F0C7) block (140 × 45 px) labeled “Output Linear.” A long vertical black arrow from the bottom center of Output Linear exits the enclosure, traveling upward (~90 px) to meet the center of the “Text” icon above.  At the lower right, centered beneath the enclosing rectangle, is a bold “Decoder” label (8 pt, dark gray).  All functional blocks, arrows, and connections remain consistently styled: rounded rectangles (corner radius: 4 pt, outline: 1 pt #333333), flat fills, and no gradients or drop-shadows. Arrows are solid black 1 pt lines with triangular heads, except where dashed style is specified. Fonts are Helvetica or similar sans-serif, semi-bold for block labels and bold for enclosure/module labels. A uniform 4 pt gap surrounds each block within their enclosures. The canvas measures 833 × 768 px, ensuring all elements are clearly and symmetrically arranged with clean vertical and horizontal alignment."
ti2i_image_caption_117="The illustration is a highly detailed scientific flowchart with a clean, flat vector style on a white background (aspect ratio near 2.1:1, approximately 3200 × 1500 px). The main modules are contained within rounded rectangles with a thick (6 px) pure-black outline and filled with various soft pastel colors. All titles use bold, classic serif font (weight about 700, size 42 pt), center-aligned within their modules. Auxiliary labels, such as component names, use italicised serif font (40 pt), pure black, positioned immediately above or below their respective elements. All arrows are very thick (14 px) with gently curved Bézier paths, ending with filled triangular arrowheads (28 × 22 px); pastel blue (#6da8e2) denotes logic-flow, pastel orange (#f5a66c) indicates control/metadata. No gradients or dashed lines are present, except for a slight linear shading on code-window browser icons.  Layout proceeds left-to-right across the canvas, with the following detailed modules and elements:  1. In the top-left corner (10% from left, 10% from top), an icon depicts a stylised browser window (210 × 130 px). The upper 20% forms a dark-teal header (#004d66) with three small traffic-light circles. The body is filled with light teal (#4fb0ca). Inside, on the left is a navy ('</>', #002b44) glyph, and on the right, two horizontal bars in yellow-orange (#f9b44c) suggest code. Above is a centered italic label, “Original Code.”  2. Immediately below the browser icon, a vertical stack contains three circular logos representing generative AI sources (each 50 × 50 px): ChatGPT swirl, Google’s multicolor “G”, and a multicolor Meta (Facebook) logo at the bottom. To the left, the italic label “LLMs” (34 pt) is center-aligned to the logo stack. A control (pastel orange) arrow flows horizontally from the midpoint of the three logos into the left border of the next main module.  3. Centered at 28% width, vertical midpoint (50%), is a rounded rectangle (360 × 160 px, peach-beige #f6dcc9) titled “LLM-Based\nRefactoring” in bold serif, centered on two lines. The block receives two arrows: one pastel blue, descending from the “Original Code” browser icon’s bottom border; a pastel orange one from the LLM logo stack’s midpoint.  4. Below “LLM-Based Refactoring” (70 px gap) is a browser code-window icon as before, with matching color scheme and glyphs, labeled “Refactored Code” in italic, centered below. Alongside this code icon (right side, same vertical alignment) appears a second code-window representing an alternate refactoring result, differentiated by having the header bar colored lavender (#8a6ee4) and two code bars in mint-green (#dcead1). Its italic label reads “Alternative Code”. A wide pastel blue arrow splits from the bottom of the “LLM-Based Refactoring” block and forks horizontally to enter the top borders of both code icons.  5. Further right at 48% width, slightly above vertical center (36%), is the block “Refactoring Discovery” (rounded rectangle, 360 × 160 px, sky-blue #cfe0ef), with bold serif title, center-aligned. This module receives two input arrows: a pastel blue arrow from the right edge of the “Original Code” browser window, and a pastel orange arrow rising upward from an icon below.  6. Below “Refactoring Discovery” (at circa 55% width, 80% height) is a black silhouette icon of a construction worker striking a rock with a hammer (100 × 110 px), representing a detection tool. Underneath is the italic label “Refactoring Detection Tool.” Its pastel orange arrow ascends to the block above.  7. “Applied Refactorings” icon sits between “Refactoring Discovery” and the next main block (at 63% width, 36% height). It comprises three overlapping code sheets (each with a white “</>” glyph): left is violet-blue (#6ba7ff), center is mint-green (#dcead1), and right sheet is pink (#f18ac9). A blue circular arrow wraps clockwise around the sheets, while a black outlined magnifying glass overlaps the lower right, suggesting analysis and transformation. The italic label “Applied Refactorings” is placed directly above.  8. At approximately 78% width, 36% height, a larger rounded rectangle (410 × 170 px, mint-green #dcead1) contains “Refactoring Reapplication” in bold serif, centered. To its top right, at 10% vertical offset, sits the flat IntelliJ IDEA logo (90 × 90 px), referencing the refactoring engine. Above the logo is the italic label “Refactoring Engine”. An orange control arrow descends from the logo’s center-bottom edge, entering the module’s top-right border.  9. Below and to the left of the “Refactoring Reapplication” block is a horizontal row of small module icons representing supplementary processes:      – “Validation” (rounded rectangle, 180 × 80 px, pale yellow #fff7c6), center-aligned bold serif title; contains a checkmark and bug icons side by side; label “Validation” below.      – “Testing” (rounded rectangle, 180 × 80 px, pastel green #d7f7c4); inside is a stylised flask and clipboard with checkmarks; label “Testing” below.      – “Quality Analysis” (rounded rectangle, 180 × 80 px, light pink #fde1eb); inside is a bar chart and magnifier icon; label “Quality Analysis” below.      Each module is aligned horizontally with 40 px gaps; pastel blue arrows sequentially connect “Refactoring Reapplication” to “Validation,” then to “Testing,” then to “Quality Analysis,” and finally link downwards to the final code block.  10. Directly below “Refactoring Reapplication” block (78% width, 80% height), a code-browser icon as earlier; the header bar uses mint-green (#dcead1), code bars remain navy and yellow-orange. Centered below is italic “Refactored Code”.  11. Arrow network:      – Pastel blue arrows route from         • “Original Code” bottom center to “LLM-Based Refactoring” top border;         • “Original Code” right border to “Refactoring Discovery” left border;         • “LLM-Based Refactoring” bottom to both code icons below;         • “Refactored Code” and “Alternative Code” right borders join into a single arrow, merging to enter “Refactoring Discovery” lower border center;         • Right border of “Refactoring Discovery” connects to left edge of “Applied Refactorings” icon;         • Right edge of “Applied Refactorings” connects to left border of “Refactoring Reapplication”;         • “Refactoring Reapplication” bottom flows to “Validation,” “Testing,” “Quality Analysis,” and finally to the final code icon.      – Pastel orange arrows flow from the LLM logos into “LLM-Based Refactoring,” from the detection tool into “Refactoring Discovery,” and from the IntelliJ IDEA logo into “Refactoring Reapplication.”  12. Color palette:      – Peach-beige (#f6dcc9), sky-blue (#cfe0ef), mint-green (#dcead1), pale yellow (#fff7c6), pastel green (#d7f7c4), light pink (#fde1eb) for module fills;      – Pastel blue (#6da8e2, logic-flow);      – Pastel orange (#f5a66c, metadata/control);      – Header bars: dark teal (#004d66), lavender (#8a6ee4), mint-green (#dcead1);      – Code glyphs: navy (#002b44), yellow-orange (#f9b44c);      – Text: pure black (#000000).  13.

On the left, a vertical backbone sequence appears, consisting of four main blocks stacked with 40 px vertical gaps:  - At the top, an arrow descends from the upper margin, labelled “input” (38-pt, regular) right-aligned just to the right and centered at the midpoint of the arrow. The arrow enters the top of Block A. - Block A: Rectangle, 220 px tall × 580 px wide, fill #c4e3d7 (pastel sea-foam), 14 px corner radius. Centered title: “Resnet(Initial Layer)”, with “Resnet” bold, parenthetical in regular. - Below, a short arrow connects to Block B. - Block B: Rectangle, same size, fill #ffeaea (very light pink), 14 px corner radius. Centered: “Attention Layer”, with “Attention” bold, “Layer” regular. - Below, a short arrow connects to Block C. - Block C: Rectangle, same size, fill #fff8ce (pastel yellow), 14 px corner radius. Centered: “Fusion Layer”, with “Fusion” bold, “Layer” regular. - Below, a short arrow connects to Block D. - Block D: Rectangle, same size, fill #c4e3d7 (pastel sea-foam), 14 px corner radius. Centered: “Resnet(Final Layer)”, with “Resnet” bold, parenthetical regular. - From the right edge center of Block D, a horizontal arrow (length ≈ 450 px) extends directly rightward, forming a skip connection.  Branching from the vertical backbone midway between Blocks A and B, a horizontal arrow (240 px) diverges rightward and splits into two distinct horizontal branches, evenly spaced vertically:  **Upper right vertical path:** - From the end of the branch-split arrow, a downward arrow leads to Block E1. - Block E1: Rectangle, 200 px tall × 530 px wide, fill #c9a6d8 (light lavender), 14 px corner radius. Centered: “GraphResBlock”, with “Graph” bold, “ResBlock” regular. - 35 px gap, short downward arrow. - Block F1: Rectangle, same size, fill #cfe0ff (soft sky blue), 14 px corner radius. Centered: “TemporalResBlock”, with “Temporal” bold, “ResBlock” regular. - 35 px gap, short downward arrow. - Block G1: Rectangle, same size, fill #b6ceaa (sage green), 14 px corner radius. Centered: “CrossAttention Layer”, with “CrossAttention” bold, “Layer” regular. - 35 px gap, short downward arrow. - Block H1: Rectangle, same size, fill #ffd7b8 (peach), 14 px corner radius. Centered: “Normalization Layer”, with “Normalization” bold, “Layer” regular. - 35 px gap, short downward arrow to the top of the left addition circle.  **Lower right vertical path:** - The second branch from the horizontal split makes a 35 px downward step and then a horizontal arrow points right to Block E2 (parallel with Block E1), then a vertical sequence: - Block E2: Rectangle, 200 px tall × 530 px wide, fill #c9a6d8 (light lavender), 14 px corner radius. Centered: “GraphResBlock”, with “Graph” bold, “ResBlock” regular. - 35 px gap, short downward arrow. - Block F2: Rectangle, same size, fill #cfe0ff (soft sky blue), 14 px corner radius. Centered: “TemporalResBlock”, with “Temporal” bold, “ResBlock” regular. - 35 px gap, short downward arrow. - Block G2: Rectangle, same size, fill #fec1c8 (light coral), 14 px corner radius. Centered: “Dense Layer”, with “Dense” bold, “Layer” regular. - 35 px gap, short downward arrow to the top of the right addition circle.  **Dual residual-addition symbols:** - At the base of both right vertical paths, two identical circles, each with 2-pt black outline, white fill, and diameter 160 px, are horizontally aligned, separated by 240 px. Both contain a black “+” symbol, made from two intersecting 80 px 2-pt black lines. - Each right-path’s last block connects down to its respective circle. The skip connection from Block D arrives horizontally to the leftmost point of the left circle. - The left circle’s right side emits a horizontal arrow (290 px), which enters the left side of a large merging rectangle.  **Merging module:** - Rectangle, 220 px tall × 580 px wide, fill #e5e5e5 (light gray), 14 px corner radius, with 44-pt centered text: “Merge Module”, “Merge” bold, “Module” regular. The right circle’s right side also emits a horizontal arrow (290 px) connecting to the merging rectangle’s left edge, both arrows spaced equally top and bottom.  A single horizontal arrow exits the right side of the merging rectangle (290 px), labelled “output” (38-pt Times New Roman, regular), label positioned just above the arrow and right-aligned with the rectangle’s right edge. All vertical and horizontal alignments are precisely maintained between left and right columns and modules, with consistent gaps (left: 40 px, right: 35 px between blocks), no gradients or dashed lines.  All text elements are perfectly centered both horizontally and vertically within their respective shapes. All corners on rectangles use a subtle 14 px rounding for visual unity. The overall presentation is crisp and precise, suitable for inclusion in a machine-learning publication."
ti2i_image_caption_119="A landscape-oriented canvas with an aspect ratio of approximately 3:2 is presented, divided equally by a solid black horizontal line at mid-height. The upper half is labeled “Gloss-Based,” and the lower half is labeled “Gloss-Free,” with these section names in bold, 20 pt, black, rotated vertically along the left edge; “Gloss-Free” also includes the red, italicized word “Ours” (16 pt) positioned adjacent to the dashed separator within the lower region.  At the top edge, a solid black BLEU-4 x-axis runs horizontally with a rightward-pointing arrowhead, labeled in bold black small caps near the end as “BLEU-4.” Above the axis are tick marks and numerical labels at intervals of 0.0, 12.0, 16.0, 20.0, 24.0, and 28.0, with a left-side y-axis break (zig-zag) at 0.0.  In the “Gloss-Based” (upper) half, two complete parallel pipelines are shown. The first pipeline (uppermost) is a three-stage stacked flow: a learnable rounded rectangle (pastel-orange, 150 × 55 px) labeled “Visual Encoder” (bold, 12 pt, centered), directly below which, overlapping by 15 px, is a frozen pastel-blue rounded rectangle of identical size and label. A small black curved arrow annotated “Parameters inheritance” (10 pt italic) connects the lower edge of the upper orange encoder to the upper edge of the lower blue encoder. Two leftward “Sign video” modules (white background, bold black outline, 85 × 35 px, bold label) connect via thin solid black arrows to both encoders. To the right of the lower encoder, a pastel-orange “LLM” block (rounded rectangle, 150 × 55 px, bold, centered), and to its right, a thin black outlined rectangle (110 × 40 px, white filled) labeled “spoken sentence,” all connected by solid black arrows. Above the “LLM” and aligned to the right of the top “Visual Encoder,” a pastel-green (160 × 45 px) rounded rectangle labeled “Gloss-based CSLR” is attached via a short upward arrow. To the far left of these modules, a vertical stack of numbers (matching BLEU-4 axis) and a small in-line legend in the bottom left lists orange: “Learnable,” blue: “Frozen,” and green: “Auxiliary,” all labeled in 9 pt sans-serif font.  Immediately beneath this, a second “Gloss-Based” pipeline mirrors the structure but employs a modified mechanism: after the “Visual Encoder” stack (orange above blue, with curved inheritance arrow), a pastel-green “Frame-level Alignment Module” (rounded rectangle, 160 × 45 px) is placed, feeding into a pastel-orange “LLM” block and then the same “spoken sentence” target. The “Frame-level Alignment Module” connects both to LLM and directly receives output from the overlap point between the encoders.  The lower “Gloss-Free” half is subdivided again by a black dashed horizontal line one-third down from the midline. In the section above the dashed line, two parallel pipelines operate. The left pipeline starts with a “Sign video” module connecting via a solid black arrow to an orange “Visual Encoder” (150 × 55 px), which links to an orange “LLM,” then “spoken sentence,” all sequenced left-to-right via solid arrows. Immediately above this pipeline, a pastel-green “Noise Suppression Module” (160 × 45 px, rounded) branches from the output of the “Visual Encoder,” with an arrow merging its output into the LLM input side.  The second parallel pipeline on the right (in the same strip) features a white “Transliteration” block (130 × 40 px, thin black outline, bold label), fed in parallel by a side arrow from the “Visual Encoder” and then outputting into the “LLM.” These two pipelines run side by side, both merging at the LLM module, and continue to the “spoken sentence” rectangle.  Below the dashed separator, a complex modular pipeline is centered, forming the “Ours” section. It begins with a “Sign video” input, feeding two learnable orange “Visual Encoder” blocks stacked vertically (with a curved “Parameters inheritance” arrow labeled as above), leading to the right into a learnable “Light-T” module (orange, 150 × 55 px, bold label). A red five-point star (radius 14 px) is superimposed in the center of “Light-T.” To the right, a large pastel-green rectangle (200 × 45 px) labeled “Video-Grounded Text Generation” is directly downstream, connected by a solid black arrow. Below these, in a parallel hierarchical track, another pair of “Visual Encoder” (orange above, blue below, curved inheritance arrow) modules feeds into a “LLM” (orange, 150 × 55 px), then into “spoken sentence,” mirroring the upper Gloss-Based stack structure. Peripheral “Sign video” inputs connect into each parallel stack via separate solid black arrows.  A new “Multimodal Fusion Module” is introduced, placed beneath “Light-T,” as a pastel-green rounded rectangle (160 × 45 px, bold label), taking parallel inputs from both a lower “Visual Encoder” and from the “Video-Grounded Text Generation” module, outputting into both the “LLM” and an adjacent white “Multimodal Output” rectangle (110 × 40 px, black border).  A continuous, thick diagonal black dotted arrow begins above the first stack in the Gloss-Based region, passing sequentially through all LLM modules in both upper and lower halves, intersecting the “Light-T” star, and terminating at a large red filled circle (radius 8 px) at BLEU-4 ≈ 28; a smaller red filled circle is at ≈ 12. Two additional intermediate red circles (radius 8 px) lie at intersections with the “Noise Suppression Module” and the “Frame-level Alignment Module,” indicating performance milestones.  All fonts are clean sans-serif (Helvetica or Arial, sizes as specified), with main block labels at 12 pt bold black, axis and legend at 10 pt, and section tags at 20 pt bold. The background is solid white; all arrows are thin, solid black except the thick black dotted diagonal arrow. No gradients or dashed module borders are present. Every module, label, arrow, and separator is fully and sharply delineated."
ti2i_image_caption_120="On a horizontal 16:9 canvas, measuring 981 px wide by 541 px tall with a flat vector style and thin uniform stroke width of 1.5 px, the background is filled with a very light cool-grey (#e6ecf0). Centered within the canvas is a large rounded rectangle (corner radius 20 px, 925 px × 495 px) serving as the main frame ('System' container), filled medium-grey-blue (#c5d1dd, 60 % opacity) with a slightly darker outline.  Inside the System container, three equal-width vertical zones are arranged side-by-side as rounded rectangles (corner radius 12 px, matching the main frame's stroke):  - Left zone is labeled 'Client,' filled with pastel sky-blue (#cfe0ff, 70 % opacity), title in bold small caps, dark-slate-grey, 17 pt font, horizontally centered at zone top. - Middle zone is labeled 'Server,' filled with pastel salmon-pink (#f5c7c7, 70 % opacity), title styled identically. - Right zone is labeled 'Evaluation,' filled with pastel mint-green (#cfe9cf, 70 % opacity), matching title style. All three zones are vertically centered at 90 % container height.  The Client zone (top-to-bottom, evenly spaced vertical alignment) contains four functional blocks as rounded rectangles (corner radius 10 px, stroke #555, 1.5 px), each ~60 % zone width and 13 % zone height: 1. 'Compute Gradients' (yellow fill, #ffeb9c, label 15 pt bold sans-serif). 2. 'Global Model' (yellow fill). 3. 'Private Data Batch' (yellow fill). 4. 'Client Privacy Module' (lavender fill, #d4bdf5, label 15 pt bold).  The Server zone (top-to-bottom) contains: 5. 'Deep Leakage Attack' (lavender fill). 6. 'Attack Analysis Module' (lavender fill). 7. 'Recovered Data Batch' (lavender fill). 8. 'Global Model Update' (yellow fill). 9. 'Aggregation Logic' (yellow fill).  The Evaluation zone (top-to-bottom) contains: 10. 'Model Metrics' (lavender fill). 11. 'Intermediate Metrics' (lavender fill). 12. 'Privacy Assessment' (yellow fill). 13. 'Overall Metrics' (lavender fill). 14. 'Visualization Output' (mint-green fill, #cfe9cf, label 15 pt bold).  Process connections are rendered as solid black arrows (stroke #000, filled arrowheads, length dynamic):  - Client vertical: arrow from 'Private Data Batch' up to 'Global Model', up to 'Compute Gradients', and a solid vertical arrow from 'Global Model' down to 'Client Privacy Module'. - Client → Server horizontal: arrow from 'Compute Gradients' right to 'Deep Leakage Attack', 'Global Model' right to 'Global Model Update', 'Private Data Batch' right to 'Global Model Update', and from 'Client Privacy Module' right to 'Attack Analysis Module'. - Server vertical: arrow from 'Deep Leakage Attack' down to 'Attack Analysis Module', then down to 'Recovered Data Batch', from 'Recovered Data Batch' down to 'Global Model Update', and further down to 'Aggregation Logic'. - Server → Evaluation horizontal: arrow from 'Attack Analysis Module' right to 'Privacy Assessment', from 'Global Model Update' right to 'Model Metrics', and from 'Recovered Data Batch' right to 'Intermediate Metrics'. - Evaluation vertical: arrow from 'Model Metrics' down to 'Intermediate Metrics', from 'Intermediate Metrics' down to 'Privacy Assessment', and from 'Privacy Assessment' down to 'Overall Metrics', then down to 'Visualization Output'.  Two thick black dashed arrows (stroke 1.5 px, dash 8 px gap 6 px) point: - From 'Compute Gradients' right to 'Attack Analysis Module'. - From 'Private Data Batch' right to 'Attack Analysis Module'. A third dashed arrow goes from 'Client Privacy Module' right to 'Attack Analysis Module'.  One light-grey dotted vertical arrow (stroke 2 px, dot-spacing 5 px) descends from 'Intermediate Metrics' to 'Privacy Assessment', and another from 'Overall Metrics' to 'Visualization Output'.  At the bottom of the parent frame, a legend bar (rounded rectangle, corner radius 15 px, height 75 px, width spanning container, fill light-grey #e7e9ed) displays left-to-right: solid black arrow with label 'Every training iteration', black dashed arrow with label 'Every attack rate', light-grey dotted arrow with label 'Once at the end', a 25×15 px yellow box labeled 'Federated Learning Process', a 25×15 px lavender box labeled 'Deep Leakage Attack Process', and a 25×15 px mint-green box labeled 'Visualization Step'; all legend text is dark-slate-grey at 13 pt.  All text in the diagram uses a modern sans-serif font (Open-Sans or Helvetica), with consistent vertical alignment and equal spacing between blocks within zones. Each zone has a subtle drop shadow (blur 4 px, opacity 15 %) for mild depth. The diagram is crisp, professional, and well-suited for a journal publication."
ti2i_image_caption_121="Canvas size is 1400 px (width) × 1000 px (height) with a white background. At the center top (x = 350 px, y = 35 px) is a grey rectangle (220 px × 50 px) labeled 'Embeddings' in black semibold sans-serif, centered.   On the left, a dashed rounded rectangle (stroke 3 pt, dash 8 px gap 6 px, corner radius 20 px), starts at (60 px, 20 px) and is sized 620 px × 920 px. Inside this group, at its bottom inner edge, there is an 18 pt italic label: 'Multi-Head Self-/Cross-Attention'.  Inside this region, processing flows vertically from the Embeddings block. The first block, placed at (260 px, 110 px), is a dark-blue (hex #8ab0ff) rounded rectangle (200 px × 60 px) labeled 'Activation\nQuantization' (two lines, centered in semibold sans-serif). A vertical black arrow (20 px) leads downward, splitting into three horizontal arrows which feed three parallel light-blue blocks:  - At (60 px, 210 px), 'Quantized Weight\nFC Q' light-blue (#cfe5ff) block, 200 px × 90 px, text centered on three lines. - At (260 px, 210 px), 'Quantized Weight\nFC K' similar block. - At (460 px, 210 px), 'Quantized Weight\nFC V' similar block.  From the center bottoms of 'FC K' and 'FC V', vertical arrows point down to lavender (#c9b7e8) blocks (200 px × 60 px), positioned at (260 px, 325 px) and (460 px, 325 px), both labeled 'KV cache\nQuantization'.   Below 'FC Q', 'FC K', and 'FC V', there are multiplication nodes: - Node A at (160 px, 410 px): a white circle 36 px diameter, 3 pt black outline, bold black “×”. Rightward-pointing arrow from 'FC Q' feeds its left edge. From 'KV cache Quantization' (under 'FC K'), a vertical wire merges into Node A from above. - Node B at (360 px, 560 px): similar circle, located below and right of Node A. From 'KV cache Quantization' (under 'FC V'), a vertical arrow enters its top. A wire from Node A runs vertically down then rightward (forming a Q–K–V interaction).  From Node B’s bottom, a vertical arrow leads to a lower dark-blue 'Activation\nQuantization' block (200 px × 60 px) at (260 px, 630 px).   At (460 px, 720 px), there is a light-blue block labeled 'Quantized\nWeight\nFC', 200 px × 90 px. A diagonal black arrow links the right edge of the 'Activation Quantization' block to the left midpoint of this FC block.  On the left dashed box’s right side, a horizontal black arrow (70 px) departs from the right edge of the 'Quantized Weight FC' block, heading toward the right group.  Directly below Node B, at (360 px, 720 px), insert a 'Residual Addition' node: a white circle 36 px in diameter with bold black “+”, 3 pt outline. An arrow from the output of 'Activation Quantization' at (260 px, 630 px) enters its top, and another arrow from 'Embeddings' (ending at an intermediate 'Skip Connection' block placed at (360 px, 670 px), a grey 160 px × 40 px rounded rectangle with label 'Skip Connection') enters its left. The output of the '+' node is merged into the path towards the right group’s feedforward processing by a new vertical arrow connecting it to the horizontal arrow.  Add a new vertical 'LayerNorm Quantization' block (180 px × 60 px, light green #b9eaf7, 90% opacity, semibold sans-serif) at (260 px, 830 px), directly underneath the last 'Activation Quantization' block in the attention group, connected by a vertical arrow.  On the right, the dashed bounding box (stroke 3 pt, dash 8 gap 6, corner radius 20 px) begins at (760 px, 120 px), size 450 px × 760 px. The title 'Feed-Forward Network' is set above and overlapping the upper right of the box in bold, 20 pt.  Vertically stacked in the right group, centered horizontally: - At (865 px, 160 px), dark-blue 'Activation Quantization' (300 px × 60 px). - 25 px vertical arrow. - At (865 px, 245 px), light-blue 'Quantized Weight FC1' (300 px × 90 px). - 25 px vertical arrow. - At (865 px, 360 px), light-blue 'LayerNorm Quantization' (300 px × 60 px, light green #b9eaf7). - 25 px vertical arrow. - At (865 px, 435 px), dark-blue 'Activation Quantization' (300 px × 60 px). - 25 px vertical arrow. - At (865 px, 520 px), light-blue 'Quantized Weight FC2' (300 px × 90 px). - 25 px vertical arrow. - At (865 px, 635 px), dark-blue 'Activation Quantization' (300 px × 60 px). - 25 px vertical arrow. - At (865 px, 720 px), light-blue 'Quantized Gated FC\n(if used)' (300 px × 90 px).  Below these, add a 'Residual Addition' node at (1015 px, 830 px): a white circle 36 px in diameter, bold black “+”, 3 pt outline. An arrow arrives from the output of 'Quantized Gated FC', entering its top, and another arrow arrives horizontally from the left (from the merged residual at the end of the left group). Below this node, a light green 'LayerNorm Quantization' block (300 px × 60 px), centered at (865 px, 900 px), is connected by a vertical arrow.  All blocks are filled with 90% opacity. All text is centered and semibold, with block titles at ~20 pt for two lines, ~18 pt for others. Arrow lines (except for wires) are solid 3 pt black with closed triangular arrowheads (10 px base, 12 px length). All module blocks use 4 pt corner radius. All modules/groups maintain 20 px minimum margin between any block and the dashed box. Equal 25 px vertical spacing separates each block in every stack.   The overall diagram maintains a highly structured, camera-ready vector appearance consistent with expert machine learning paper figures, with all colors, text, and elements clearly defined and precise."
ti2i_image_caption_122="The image is a high-resolution schematic (A4 portrait, white background) illustrating the detailed structure of an enhanced “Cross-Attention Block” for transformer networks, rendered in clean vector style with precise 1-pt black contours and arrows, rounded rectangles (3-pt radius), and a clear pastel colour palette.  ──── PART-1   (BOTTOM: High-Level Overview) ──── Centrally positioned at the bottom half is a wide, rounded rectangle labeled “Cross Attention Block” in bold, 10-pt black serif font. The rectangle measures approximately 55% of page width and 9% of page height and is filled with a vertical gradient (top #d9e2f8, bottom #bcd0f0). Beneath this block, centered, is the text “× 6” in 9-pt italic black, denoting six stacked blocks.  To the left, a vertical stack of five small empty squares (6 mm sides, 1-pt green stroke #4da450, no fill) are evenly spaced inside a dashed rounded rectangle (1-pt green dash, 2-pt radius, 4-pt gap pattern). Below this arrangement, left-aligned, is the text “Input Query” in 9-pt black font. To the right, mirrored, is a vertical stack of five mustard-yellow (#efc550) stroked squares within a similarly dashed, rounded rectangle of the same colour; beneath, right-aligned, reads “Input Value/Key”.  Solid black arrows (1-pt triangular heads) extend from the green and yellow dashed blocks horizontally into the left and right edge-centres of the “Cross Attention Block”. From the top-centre of this main block, a broad, upward-pointing isosceles triangular wedge (≈40 mm tall, base matches the rectangle width) is filled with a vertical blue gradient (#d0e0ff at base to transparent at tip) and leads visually to the upper sub-diagram.  ──── PART-2   (TOP: Extended Internal Layout) ──── The upper section is enclosed by a black dashed rounded rectangle (corner radius 4 pt, 1-pt stroke, 4-pt dash gaps) matching the width of the lower main block. This section includes all internal operations arranged on an invisible left-to-right grid.  A) INPUT BRANCHES — Leftmost: “Query” Path — Bottom node: Rounded rectangle (24 × 8 mm), white fill, green border (#4da450), labeled “Query Proj.”; above it (5 mm gap), pastel blue (#dae2f7) rectangle “LayerNorm”. Above (5 mm gap), light-green (#cfead2) rectangle labeled italic “E_Q”. Ascending from “E_Q”, a pastel purple (#e3d7f7) rectangle labeled “Positional Encoding”.  — Rightmost: “Value/Key” Path — Bottom node: Rounded rectangle, pale butter-yellow fill (#fff4d0), border #d6c483, labeled “Value/Key Proj.”; above (5 mm gap) pastel blue rectangle “LayerNorm”. Above, two upward-splitting arrows to:   • Pale-salmon (#f5d7c4) rectangle “E_V”   • Mustard-yellow (#f0cc55) rectangle “E_K” Both centred at E_Q’s height. Above E_K, a pastel purple (#e3d7f7) rectangle “Positional Encoding”.  B) INTERMEDIATE EMBEDDING COMBINATION Between “E_Q” and its “Positional Encoding” node, a white plus-circle (6 mm diameter, black border, ‘+’ label). Two arrows enter this: one from “E_Q”, one from “Positional Encoding”. Similarly, between “E_K” and its positional node, another identical plus-circle with arrows from “E_K” and “Positional Encoding”.  C) ATTENTION COMPUTATION Centrally above, a white multiplication circle (‘×’) receives arrows from the output of the left plus node (“E_Q+Positional Encoding”) and from “E_V”. Above, a white rectangle, black border: “Softmax”; arrow enters from this “×”; simultaneously, an arrow from the right plus node (“E_K+Positional Encoding”) feeds into the left side of “Softmax”.  Above “Softmax”, an additional multiplication node (white circle, ‘×’). Left input: Softmax output; right input: “E_V”.  D) LINEAR PROJECTION & GATING Above, pastel blue rounded rectangle: “Linear Proj.”. Immediately right of “Linear Proj.”, a smaller pastel-pink (#f7dae6) rounded rectangle labeled “Gating Module”. A horizontal arrow from the output of “Linear Proj.” enters “Gating Module”; the output merges with the main vertical flow via a plus-circle (white, ‘+’) directly above both.  E) RESIDUAL CONNECTIONS The first plus-circle (after “Linear Proj.” and “Gating Module”) receives a long horizontal arrow (aligned on grid, right-angle turns) from the left “LayerNorm” node (under “Query Proj.”), forming the first residual connection.  Above, a pastel blue rectangle “LayerNorm”; next, a white plus-circle (‘+’), which receives a second long horizontal residual arrow starting at the dashed frame's left border just above “E_Q+Positional Encoding”, bypassing intermediate modules.  F) FEED-FORWARD NETWORK BLOCKS Above the second plus-circle, a pastel blue rounded rectangle labeled “FFN”. To the right of FFN, a vertical stack of two pastel green (#eaf6e7) rounded rectangles:   • Bottom: “Dropout” (smaller size)   • Top: “BatchNorm” (identical size) A vertical arrow ascends from “FFN” into “Dropout”, continues into “BatchNorm”, and merges back with the main vertical flow via a plus-circle (white, ‘+’) above “LayerNorm”.  G) OUTPUT Above the final plus node, a pastel blue rectangle “LayerNorm”. An arrow exits its top, piercing the dashed bounding box and indicating output to subsequent stages.  H) AUXILIARY CONTROL BRANCH In the upper right of the dashed frame, a small rounded rectangle (8 × 16 mm, pastel red #f4c4c7) labeled “Attention Mask”. A horizontal dashed black arrow leads from “Attention Mask” into the right-hand side of the central “Softmax” box.  I) ARROW STYLES AND SYMMETRY All arrows are solid black, 1-pt, triangular heads; horizontal and vertical guides ensure alignment. Residual arrows are perfectly parallel, with precise right-angle turns.  J) NODE LABELLING AND COLOURS Node labels: 9-pt bold serif font. Subscripts in “E_Q”, “E_K”, “E_V” italic. All module names rendered as described. Pastel colour summary:   • LayerNorm, Linear Proj., FFN: #cbd9f3   • Query-side nodes: Border #4da450, fill #eaf6e7, #cfead2   • Value/Key nodes: Border #d6c483, fill #fff4d0, #f5d7c4, #f0cc55   • Operator nodes: white fill, black stroke   • Gating, auxiliary modules: pastel-pink #f7dae6, pastel-purple #e3d7f7, pastel-red #f4c4c7   • Bounding boxes: black stroke, 4-pt dash pattern  All elements are perfectly symmetric, pixel-sharp, and organized for clarity and publication-grade presentation."

Lavender residual-addition circle (24 px diameter, #D0B7D7) after (b), with a bold, centred white “+” (16 pt).      d. “LayerNorm” (light-green): 110 × 36 px, connected via a right-pointing arrow from the circle.      e. “Feed Forward” (new module, pale-blue #B3D1E6): 140 × 36 px, connected by a right-pointing arrow.      f. Lavender residual-addition circle (24 px) with a bold white “+”, right-pointing arrow to (g).      g. “Weightless Network” (light-steel-blue, #A9C6DF): 170 × 36 px, connected by black arrow.      h. Final lavender residual-addition circle (24 px) with bold white “+”. Arrow exits right side of dashed rectangle.    - Above the block’s top-right corner, the label “× L layers” (italic, 11 pt).    - All arrows between modules are horizontal with neat elbow bends where necessary and exactly 20 px vertical spacing.    - After the final “+” circle, a horizontal arrow extends to the right boundary, signifying pipeline continuation.  4. **Leader Line to Bottom Block:**     - A dotted, right-angled arrow from the midpoint of the “Weightless Network” rectangle’s right edge descends at a 45-degree angle, bends, and terminates at the left border of the bottom dotted rectangle.  **BOTTOM BLOCK (Weightless Network Detail)**  A tall upright dotted rectangle (~600 × 240 px) contains six modules, each as a vertically oriented rounded rectangle (equal widths and heights, precisely spaced).  1. **Activations Flattened Out:**     - Far left, lavender rectangle (#CBB7E7): 120 × 120 px.    - Label uses two lines: “Activations Flattened Out” (11 pt, bold) and “(row-wise)” (9 pt, regular).    - Three arrows emanate from its right edge: one to “Thermometer Encodings”, two diagonally to “LUT Layer 1” and “LUT Layer 2”.  2. **Thermometer Encodings:**     - Next, orange (#E0AE6D): 120 × 120 px, labelled “Thermometer Encodings”.    - Three arrows exit right: one straight to “LUT Layer 1”, two diagonally to “LUT Layer 2” and “LUT Layer 3”.  3. **LUT Layers:**     - Three consecutive very-light-yellow (#FFF2B3) rectangles, each 120 × 120 px, labelled “LUT Layer 1”, “LUT Layer 2”, and “LUT Layer 3”.     - Arrows are drawn from “Thermometer Encodings” and “Activations Flattened Out” to the three LUT layers in a fan-like arrangement, showing parallel processing paths.    - Each LUT layer outputs to the “Ternary Summation” by a straight horizontal arrow.  4. **Ternary Summation:**     - Rightmost, cyan (#9ED7DE) rounded rectangle, 120 × 120 px, labelled “Ternary Summation”.    - Three thick arrows converge from the left (from LUT Layer 1, 2, and 3), entering the centre of “Ternary Summation”.  5. **Output to Latent Space:**    - From “Ternary Summation,” three short parallel black arrows exit the rectangle at the right edge.    - To the right, vertically arranged, bold label “Latent Space” (12 pt, rotated top-to-bottom; centre-aligned to the arrows).  **ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS**  - All arrows have solid, triangular heads (8 px long). - Module alignment is absolute: equal horizontal separation (≈20 px) between each module; all modules are vertically and horizontally flush. - Residual-addition circles throughout both blocks are identical: lavender fill, 24 px diameter, heavy-weight white “+”. - All fonts are sans-serif, modern, and bolded for primary labels. - All colours are pure, flat, and precisely match hex codes, with no gradients or dashes except specified border styles. - No extraneous graphical elements—every component is crisply delineated and spaced for maximal clarity and symmetry. - All rectangles use a 6 px corner radius for a uniform rounded style.  The figure is visually balanced, highly detailed, and optimized for clarity in research publication layouts."
ti2i_image_caption_124="A clean, vector-style scientific diagram is set on a pure-white background, with a 3:2 aspect ratio (approximately 1600 px width by 1066 px height). The illustration is split into two main horizontal panels of equal height, separated by a 50 px blank space. All blocks use 4 px corner radius rounded rectangles; all arrows are solid, 6 px-wide black lines.

Each block is 260 px tall by 120 px wide, with 80 px horizontal gaps.  • Block #1 (far left): pastel-peach fill (#FFE7C5), 2 px dark-gold stroke (#D9A530). The label, rotated 90° clockwise, reads “Multi-Head (Masked) Attention” (aligned with deliberate line breaks after “Multi-Head” and “(Masked)”).   • Block #2: pastel-green fill (#D0EBCF), 2 px mid-green stroke (#5E9B5E), label (horizontal) reads “Add & Norm”.  • Block #3: pastel-yellow fill (#FFF6CC), 2 px goldenrod stroke (#D9C430), label (rotated 90° clockwise) reads “Feedforward Gating”.  • Block #4: pastel-rose fill (#F8CCCC), 2 px muted-red stroke (#E37B7B), label (rotated 90° clockwise) reads “Multi-Layer Perceptron”. This block is overlaid by a solid black X (not dashed), comprising two diagonal lines (both 6 px wide) from corner to corner, indicating suppression.  • Block #5 (far right): pastel-green fill (#D0EBCF), 2 px mid-green stroke (#5E9B5E), label (horizontal) reads “Add & Norm”.  • The main dataflow: a thick black arrow (6 px) enters from the extreme left, traverses sequentially through Blocks #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5, then exits at the right boundary of the panel. All arrows are straight and solid with triangle heads.  • Residual (skip) connections:  • First residual: From the left input point, a 6 px black line climbs vertically 50 px, runs above Blocks #1–#3, descends to merge at the right edge of Block #3, joining the forward path just before Block #4.  • Second residual: From the output of Block #2, a black line climbs 50 px above Block #3, crosses overhead, then drops to merge at the entry of Block #5.  • Third residual: From the output of Block #3, a black line climbs 50 px, runs horizontally above Block #4, then descends to merge with the main arrow just after Block #5, before the final right-hand exit arrow.  ─────MID-PANEL CONNECTOR  In the center between panels is a prominent double-stemmed downward arrow: each stem is 4 px black outline with a fill of pastel-blue (#AED0FF), running parallel for 40 px, merging into a wide arrowhead (head height 40 px), signifying conceptual substitution and complexity transfer.  ─────BOTTOM PANEL – “Advanced Quasi-Weightless Transformer”  • The title “Advanced Quasi-Weightless Transformer” is centered, 40 px above the blocks in 36 pt bold sans-serif.  • Six vertically oriented rounded rectangles are arrayed left-to-right, matching the height and width of the top panel blocks, spaced 60 px apart for compactness.  • Block #1: pastel-peach fill (#FFE7C5), 2 px dark-gold stroke (#D9A530), label rotated 90° clockwise, “Multi-Head (Masked) Attention”.  • Block #2: pastel-green fill (#D0EBCF), 2 px mid-green stroke (#5E9B5E), label horizontal, “Add & Norm”.  • Block #3: light-aqua fill (#D1F3FF), 2 px blue-green stroke (#5EAEC7), label rotated, reads “Sparse Token Mixer”.  • Block #4: light-lavender fill (#D9CCF2), 2 px muted-violet stroke (#9676C7), label rotated, “Weightless Block”.  • Block #5: pastel-mint fill (#CFFFE1), 2 px teal-green stroke (#37B598), label rotated, “Dynamic Routing”.  • Block #6: pastel-green fill (#D0EBCF), 2 px mid-green stroke (#5E9B5E), label horizontal, “Add & Norm”.  • The main forward dataflow: a continuous, solid black 6 px arrow traverses all six blocks from the left edge, weaving through each block in order, terminating at the right boundary.  • Residual (skip) connections:  • Initial residual: From the input at left, a 6 px black line climbs 50 px, travels horizontally over Blocks #1–#2, and drops to merge at Block #3’s left edge.  • Next residual: From the output of Block #2, a line climbs 50 px, runs above Blocks #3–#4, drops to merge into Block #5.  • An additional skip: From the output of Block #3, a line climbs 50 px, travels above Blocks #4–#5, and descends to merge with the output between Block #5 and #6.  • Final skip: From the output of Block #4, a line climbs 50 px, extends above Block #5, and drops to merge at the Block #6’s input.  All elements display precise horizontal alignment and perfect vertical symmetry. All module blocks are clearly separated by even gaps. No gradients, no dashed lines are present anywhere—colors are solid, lines are bold and uniform. The overall composition is minimalist and uncluttered, scientifically precise, and fully self-contained."
ti2i_image_caption_125="The image shows a scientific architectural diagram with a landscape layout (1920×1220 px, aspect ratio 1.6:1) and pure white background. All elements use a flat vector style with 3 px solid black borders and 90° corners, plus a subtle light gray drop-shadow at 10% opacity. Text appears in bold condensed sans-serif, perfectly horizontal and pure black, sized proportionally to its container blocks.  On the left side, a vertical stack of three rectangles appears, each separated by a 40 px vertical gap: 1. The top rectangle, labeled “GPU” (64 pt), is 230×160 px, with fill #F4B400 and 8 px rounded corners. 2. The middle rectangle, labeled “CPU” (64 pt), is identical in size, located directly below the GPU block, filled #1FA743. 3. Beneath, a third rectangle labeled “FPGA” (64 pt), same dimensions and style, filled with blue #1565C0.  To the right, occupying the right 75% of the canvas and aligned flush to the right border, are four horizontally stacked grey containers, each 200 px tall with 1480 px width and 20 px corner radius, separated by 50 px vertical gaps: A) Topmost is “HBM”, labeled (48 pt) at the top left inside the bar. On the right end, an external annotation “< 80 GB” (42 pt). Inside HBM:    - Three lime (#63E455) pill-shaped rectangles with black 3 px borders arrayed horizontally in the upper half, each 300×70 px, with 20 px top gap and 15 px vertical gaps. From left to right: “Activations”, “Non-experts”, “Expert Buffer”.    - On the right side, a large vertical lime rectangle labeled “Expert Cache”, 330 px wide, full bar height minus 60 px vertical margins, vertically centered label.    - Below “Expert Cache”, a narrow horizontal lime rectangle (220×36 px) labeled “Feature Map Cache”.    - Near the bottom center, a small upward-pointing black arrow (12 px head, 4 px shaft) emerges from the vertical backbone line.  B) Second is “DDR” bar, with label (48 pt) top left and “< 1 T” (42 pt) capacity note top right. Inside DDR:    - In the center, a wide lime rectangle (740×120 px), labeled “Experts” (centered).    - Right of “Experts”, a medium lime rectangle (220×80 px), labeled “Intermediate Results”.    - On the leftmost DDR, a column of three stacked tiny lime squares (each 48×48 px) representing “Cache Pages”, centered on the vertical backbone, with vertical 14 px gap between squares.    - A short 40 px upward black arrow spans atop the top square and connects to HBM’s arrow.  C) Third is “NVMe SSD”, labeled (48 pt) top left and “> 1 T” (42 pt) at top right. Lower 60% of bar, starting 20 px beneath top border, contains a wide lime rectangle (≈80% bar width), left half labeled “Model Weights”, right half labeled “Expert Shards”, separated by a thin solid vertical black divider (3 px stroke).    - Right edge of SSD contains a vertical stack of two thin lime rectangles, labeled “Metadata Cache” and “Index Buffer” (each 120×32 px), spaced 20 px apart.  D) Fourth bar is “Distributed Storage”, labeled (48 pt) top left with annotation “+10 T” (42 pt) right. Inside, one huge lime rectangle, full bar width minus 60 px margins (1420×140 px), labeled “Archived Experts & Data”, centered both vertically and horizontally.  A large dashed orange (#F4A25E, 5 px stroke, dash-gap 16-10) boundary frames the DDR, NVMe SSD, and Distributed Storage bars, providing a 25 px gap from all their borders. Its bottom center is overlapped by a bold black caption (52 pt): “Extended Memory Pool (DDR / SSD / Storage)”.  Bandwidth and connection lines: - GPU and CPU (plus FPGA) each connect to the left edges of the respective HBM, DDR, and NVMe SSD bars by thick solid black horizontal lines (4 px stroke, 270 px length). - A vertical black line (4 px) connects these three horizontal segments, 35 px right of the left blocks. At equal intervals along this backbone, three bandwidth annotations appear (all 40 pt, slightly left-justified): between GPU and CPU: “~ 32 GB/s”; between CPU and FPGA: “~ 18 GB/s”; between FPGA and top of dashed orange box: “~ 3 GB/s”. - From the center bottom of the NVMe SSD “Expert Shards” rectangle, a black downward-pointing arrow connects directly to the “Distributed Storage” bar. - A main vertical backbone line (4 px solid black, no dashes) runs from the center-bottom of Distributed Storage, upward through NVMe SSD and DDR, terminating at HBM just below “Non-experts”; at each transition (i.e., SSD to DDR, DDR to HBM, HBM to Activations), a small filled black arrowhead (12×22 px) indicates upward or downward data flow. - From “Expert Cache” in HBM, a short horizontal black line connects to the right vertical boundary of HBM, displaying a black annotation “Fast Swap”.  All arrows are filled solid black, no outlines. All objects maintain a consistent 20 px gap between neighboring items unless specified. There are no gradient fills, grid lines, or rotated text. No additional legends beyond the displayed block labels and capacity notes."

Directly above, a large sky-blue filled “Block 2” (200 × 70 px, black border, labelled “Block 2” in bold). On top of “Block 2” is a smaller, horizontally-centred purple rectangle (100 × 30 px, #C39DFA, black border, 4 px radius), labelled “Sub-block 2a” in bold, with italic text above it “sub-dim = k₁”. 4. To the left of “Block 2”, horizontally aligned, a light-blue (20% opacity) dashed-outline block labelled “Block 1” (200 × 70 px), with bold label inside. Slightly overlapping above “Block 1” and shifted left is another dashed block of same style (110 × 30 px), labelled “Sub-block 1a” and above it “sub-dim = k₂”. 5. To the right of “Block 2”, similarly aligned, a dashed block labelled “Block 3” (200 × 70 px). Slightly above and overlapping, a smaller dashed block (110 × 30 px), “Sub-block 3a”, with “sub-dim = k₃” above. 6. Above “Block 2”, another solid black upward arrow leads to the white “Output” block (140 × 60 px) at the top.  7. Above “Output” is a small sky-blue “Auxiliary” block (90 × 40 px) with black border, linked by a solid black upward arrow to “Output” and labelled “Auxiliary” in bold.  8. To the left of “Auxiliary” is italic dimension annotation “dim = d/2”, to its right “aux = m”. 9. The main blocks are annotated: above Block 2’s left, “dim = d – k”, above Block 2’s top, “dim = d”, above Block 2’s right, “dim = d + k”, all in italic. 10. A complex feedback path: a grey wide dashed semi-circular arrow starts at centre-right edge of “Auxiliary”, curves around above the main stack, arrowhead points at top of Block 3a, continues down the right side to the right of “Input” with arrowhead, then beneath Input (arrowhead at Block 1a), then rises left to left-edge centre of “Block 1,” continues to join bottom left corner of Output, with all arrowheads medium-grey.  Right sub-figure, label underneath: “(b) Multi-level Weight Entanglement”, bold, 14 pt, centred.  1. Vertical backbone: bottom “Input” block (white, 140 × 60 px, black border). Solid black upward arrow to the main “Entangled Bar”. 2. Main entangled region: wide two-part horizontal bar (450 × 70 px, black border, filled sky-blue), centred vertically. Inside the bar, two vertical dashed black lines split it into three sections: from left to right, 30%, 50%, and 20% widths.    - Leftmost section: “Block 1” (label inside top, bold), below it in smaller italic, “dim = d – k”.    - Centre section: “Block 2” (top label, bold), below in italic “dim = d”.    - Rightmost section: “Block 3” (top label, bold), below in italic “dim = d + k”. 3. Above the horizontal bar, two short dashed horizontal rulers mark the full bar width, text “entangled dim = D” centred above. 4. Below, directly under “Block 2”, two dashed horizontal lines (spanning only the centre section), text “core dim = d” between. Under the left and right sections, similar dashed lines with “dim = d – k” (left) and “dim = d + k” (right). 5. Extending from the right of the main bar with a 4 px gap, a light-blue (20% opacity) dashed-outlined rectangle (160 × 70 px) labelled “Block 4 (inactive)” in bold, with italic “dim = d + k₁”. 6. Directly under the bar, connected to its midpoint by a solid black downward arrow, is a white rectangle labelled “Intermediate Output” (120 × 40 px), bold label. Beneath this, connected by a solid black downward arrow, is another white block “Input” (140 × 60 px), bottom-most. 7. Above the “Entangled Bar”, horizontally to the far left and right, are two small rectangular boxes (“Context A” and “Context B”, each 80 × 36 px, filled #FFD966 yellow, black border, bold label), each connected by solid black diagonal lines (arrows) meeting the bar’s top left and top right corners, respectively. 8. Dashed grey semi-circular feedback arrow starts at the top right corner of “Block 4 (inactive)”, arcs above to “Context B”, then curves around the sub-figure’s right and lower edge, arrowhead at the lower right of “Intermediate Output”, continues left below to the lower left of “Context A” and loops upward to the left edge of “Block 1”. 9. All relevant block and section labels are bold, Times-like serif, pure black. Dimension annotations are italic and 16 pt. 10. All blocks, arrows, dashed outlines, and rulers use solid black or specified greys, with no gradients or dashed fills; all corners have 4 px radius.  The figure's visual complexity is enhanced by inclusion of sub-block modules, auxiliary connections, context modules, extra annotations, and clear feedback pathways, maintaining distinct “On” (saturated blue) and “Off” (20% blue, dashed outline) styles for schematic clarity."
ti2i_image_caption_127="The diagram is set on a 1920 × 1365 px landscape raster canvas with a very-pale cool grey (#EDEFF1) background. A large black-stroked rounded rectangle frame (30 px corner-radius, 5 px stroke) sits 20 px inside each canvas edge, enclosing all nodes and arrows.  Inside the frame, the flowchart consists of three main columns, structured as follows (left to right alignment):  **Column 1 (left side, aligned at 220 px from the frame's left):**  - At the top, a large lavender rounded rectangle (330 × 110 px, 18 px radius) contains two centred lines of bold black text: “Initial Captions” and “(S₍random₎)”. - Directly below, a vertical black arrow (120 px length) links downward to a peach rounded rectangle (330 × 110 px, 18 px radius) labelled in bold: “Coverage Calculation”. - A vertical black arrow (120 px) leads down to a pale-yellow decision diamond (240 px per side, 5 px stroke). Inside, three lines read: “Aspect Classification”, “Is aspect”, “covered?”. - From the decision diamond, two labelled paths diverge:     - The YES path: vertical black arrow (120 px) going down, with a white “YES” label box (64 × 42 px, 3 px radius, 1.5 px stroke) offset 24 px right of the arrow, connects to a sage-green rounded rectangle (420 × 110 px, 18 px radius): “Update global coverage vector” plus “(V₍final₎)” on line 3.     - The NO path: horizontal black arrow (260 px) pointing right, with a white “NO” label box touching the top of the arrow 40 px from the diamond, leads into the left centre of a turquoise rectangle in column 2. - From the bottom of the sage-green node, a horizontal black arrow (340 px) extends right to the left edge of a new diamond in column 2.  **Column 2 (centre, aligned at 1070 px from left frame edge):**  - At the top, a small turquoise rounded rectangle (350 × 90 px, 18 px radius) labelled: “Audio Vector Extractor”. - Below, a wider turquoise rounded rectangle (420 × 110 px, 18 px radius): “Frozen GPT-3.5 turbo model”. Two arrows converge here:     - The leftwards NO arrow from column 1.     - From the top-centre, a downward black arrow (120 px) comes from the “Audio Vector Extractor” node. - A grey horizontal data-flow line (620 px, 5 px stroke, #8E8E8E), starting from the right-centre of the “Coverage Calculation” node in column 1, meets the left-centre of the “Frozen GPT-3.5 turbo model” node here. - Beneath the turquoise node, a vertical black arrow (120 px) leads into a decision diamond (240 px per side, pale-yellow fill, 5 px stroke): three lines in bold read “Is full”, “coverage”, “achieved?”. - This diamond connects via two labelled arrows:     - YES path: horizontal arrow (260 px), “YES” label box (48 px from the diamond) just above, leading into the left-centre of the “Redundancy Check” node in column 3.     - NO path: diagonal arrow (45° up and right, 160 px), “NO” label 32 px left of the midpoint, entering the bottom-centre of the turquoise rectangle.  **Column 3 (right side, aligned at 1515 px from the frame's left):**  - At the top, a sage-green rounded rectangle (450 × 110 px, 18 px radius): “Intermediates for calibration set”. - Below, a tall lavender vertical rounded rectangle (420 × 500 px, 25 px corner-radius, black stroke) contains a centred stylised yellow butterfly icon (two isosceles trapezoids, both 220 px wide outer side, 140 px wide inner, 200 px tall, #FFE484, no stroke). Beneath the icon, centred text: “Trained Audio” and “Diffusion Model”. - From the top-centre of this model node, a vertical black arrow (120 px) goes up into the “Intermediates for calibration set” node. - Beneath the diffusion model, a vertical black arrow (120 px) leads down to a lavender rounded rectangle (420 × 110 px, 18 px radius): “final caption set” and “(S₍final₎)” on line 2. - Beneath that, another vertical black arrow (120 px) ends in a light-orange rounded rectangle (420 × 110 px, 18 px radius): “Redundancy Check” and “(R(S₍final₎))” on line 2. - From the left-centre of the “Redundancy Check” node, the YES arrow from the decision diamond in column 2 connects.  **Additional nodes and connections for increased complexity:**  - Directly beneath the “Coverage Calculation” node, a horizontal arrow (220 px) points right to a sage-green rounded rectangle (300 × 90 px, 18 px radius): “Aspect Selection Module”, “(A₍selected₎)”.     - From this node, a vertical arrow (110 px) goes down into the “Frozen GPT-3.5 turbo model” rectangle in column 2. - Between the “final caption set” and the “Redundancy Check” nodes, insert a pale-yellow diamond (220 px per side, 5 px stroke): three lines, “Are all captions unique?”, “Redundancy Test”, “Decision”.     - From the “final caption set”, a vertical arrow leads to the top of this new diamond.     - YES path (horizontal arrow, 180 px, labelled “YES”) from the diamond into the “Redundancy Check” node.     - NO path (vertical arrow, 120 px, labelled “NO”) leading to a small lavender rounded rectangle (210 × 70 px, 18 px radius): “Remove duplicates”, below and left of the “Redundancy Check” node. From the right-centre of this node, a horizontal arrow (130 px) leads back into the “final caption set” node, creating a feedback loop.  **Micro-details:** - All rectangles, diamonds, and icons have a subtle drop shadow (15% black, 12 px blur, 7 px offset), except arrows and outer frame. - All arrows attach via geometric edge centres of nodes and diamonds, with visually separated anchor points for parallel or converging edges. - No gradients or dashed lines are present; all fills are flat and strokes solid. - All text is bold black Arial or similar sans-serif, sized as follows: rectangle/diamond titles 34 pt; variables 30 pt; decision-edge labels 28 pt, centred within tiny white rounded rectangles (64 × 42 px, 3 px radius, 1.5 px black stroke). - Vertical stacks maintain precisely 120 px arrow separations for consistent rhythm. - All modules, shapes, and lines are precisely sized and aligned by the given coordinates to maintain order and clarity. - No elements overlap; each node, edge, label, and icon occupies distinct, clearly defined space.  This creates a visually balanced, publication-ready scientific flowchart with expanded complexity, integrating additional modules such as the “Aspect Selection Module” and “Redundancy Test Decision” while maintaining exacting alignment, palette, and style."
ti2i_image_caption_128="On a clean white horizontal A4 canvas (16:9 ratio), the diagram is organized into three main horizontal layers: Input Signal Processing at 20% canvas height, Reference and Clock Generation at 60%, and Output Post-Processing at 80%, with ample white space between modules and all shapes and lines anti-aliased.  At the top left (x = 8%, y = 20%), a 40 px-radius grass green circle contains a single-period sine wave, labeled 'Input' above in bold, left-aligned, sans-serif, 24 pt. A horizontal black arrow, 60 px, leads to a blue-outlined rounded rectangle ADC (110×70 px, “ADC” centered, bold, 20 pt).  From the ADC’s right edge, a horizontal black arrow (80 px) proceeds to a blue-outlined rounded rectangle labeled 'Digital Processor' (130×80 px, bold, centered), which represents additional preprocessing. From this block, a black arrow (80 px) forks 90° upward and downward, creating two branches.  The upper branch connects to a blue mixer circle (60 px diameter, x = 45%, y = 20%) with a bold blue “×” inside. A horizontal black arrow (100 px) leads right into a blue square Low-Pass Filter (70×70 px, slanted blue response triangle inside). From its right edge, a short black horizontal arrow (40 px) emerges, labeled “I” (italic serif, above, 20 pt).  The lower branch connects to a blue mixer circle (60 px diameter, x = 45%, y = 30%), with identical styling. A horizontal arrow (100 px) enters another blue LPF square. Its right edge outputs a short black horizontal arrow (40 px), with “Q” (italic serif, below, 20 pt).  Both I and Q arrows bend 45° to converge upward and downward into a blue-outlined, larger rounded rectangle “Arctan” block (130×80 px, centered at x = 83%, y = 25%). The input arrows enter at upper and lower thirds of the left edge.  From the Arctan block’s right edge, a black horizontal arrow (80 px) leads to a blue rectangle labeled “Phase Unwrapper” (110×70 px, bold, centered). Finally, a last black horizontal arrow (60 px) proceeds to the word “Phase” (bold, sans-serif, 24 pt), placed near the right edge (x ≈ 96%, y = 25%).  In the middle layer (y = 60%), at x = 8%, a grass green circle (40 px) with a sine wave signifies the reference signal, labeled “REF” above (bold, 24 pt). A 60 px horizontal arrow leads to an amber-outlined rounded rectangle “Clock” (110×70 px, centered, bold), which outputs a 70 px horizontal arrow to an amber circle (radius 38 px) containing a green sine icon and “NCO” label below (bold, sans-serif, 20 pt).  From the NCO, three arrows originate: 1. An upward black arrow (45° angle) reaches y = 20%, x = 55%, then left 20 px into the upper mixer. Above this segment, the label “sin(2πf_NCO)” (italic serif, 18 pt). 2. A vertical arrow rises to y = 30%, x = 55%, turns left 20 px into the lower mixer. Below this segment, “cos(2πf_NCO)” label (italic, 18 pt). 3. A horizontal arrow (60 px) heads right toward a blue-outlined circle (50 px diameter) at x = 64%, y = 60%, labeled “Sync Out” (bold, below), indicating clock/trigger output.  At the bottom layer (y = 80%, x = 20%), a blue-outlined rounded rectangle “Diagnostics” (90×60 px, bold, centered) is connected by short vertical black arrows from both the “Digital Processor” and the “Phase Unwrapper”, showing auxiliary outputs for further analysis.  Every line and shape has a solid 3 px stroke with rounded ends; module names and axis labels are bold, black sans-serif (20 pt), while mathematical labels are italic serif (18 pt), baseline-aligned. All shapes are filled white within their outlines. All junctions and elbows are crisp right angles (elbow radius 5 px), no gradients or dashed lines used. Parallel horizontal paths maintain 20 px separation, while vertical subsystem layers are spaced by 30 px. All modules, arrows, labels, and icons are spaced to prevent any overlap, ensuring sharp print resolution and a high legibility, publication-ready design."

Lower-middle, left: an orange rectangle (28 mm x 14 mm, #F0B174), labeled “GLU” (centered). 4. Lower-right: a light-gray rectangle (20 mm x 10 mm, #E0E0E0) labeled “Dropout” (centered).  A solid bold vertical arrow enters the outer peach frame at the top-left, hugging the left wall down to the GLU block.   From the GLU right edge, a horizontal black arrow extends right, bifurcating with two parallel branches: - The top branch leads right and then turns sharply up to the white “1-D Conv” block. - The lower branch leads right and then curves downward and leftward to the light-gray “Dropout” block.  Above the upper connecting branch, slightly above the line, is the label “Temporal Gated-Conv” (10 pt). The “1-D Conv” block is connected by a vertical line downward to the “BatchNorm” block, which then connects diagonally downward/right into the right side of the “Dropout” block. The output of “Dropout” merges at a node, where a final arrow points straight down exiting the peach frame.  Beneath the output arrow tip is the output label “(V^{l}_{t-M+K}, … , V^{l}_{t})” (italic math, 9 pt).   Above the input arrow, outside the top edge of the frame, is the input label “(V^{l}_{t-M+1}, … , V^{l}_{t})”.  **Stylistic and Structural Notes**   - All rectangles and modules use crisp, 1.5 pt black strokes, corners rounded 1 mm radius.   - Text is perfectly centered horizontally and vertically in each module. - All arrows are solid black, 1.2 pt wide, with filled triangular heads. - All font is clean sans-serif (Helvetica Neue or similar): 11 pt for module labels, 9 pt italic for indexed/math symbols, panel input/output, and internal process labels. - All division elements, connectors, and arrows are fully opaque (no gradients or dashed/dotted lines except central dots in division bars), with zero shadowing. - All module fills are solid (no gradients). - Margins around each panel are equal (10 mm), with strict alignment and spacing.  **Color Summary**   - ST-Conv: #B6D3E4   - Output Layer: #B9D9A6   - Blue outer block/BatchNorm: #C7E1F3   - Salmon blocks: #F5B49E   - Yellow spatial: #FAE6A4   - Violet normalization: #DBD2EE   - Peach outer: #F4C5A8   - Orange GLU: #F0B174   - Gray Dropout: #E0E0E0   - White Conv: #FFFFFF    This layout provides a high-resolution, modular illustration of a deep spatio-temporal model with expanded internal structure, increased functional detail, and multiple inter-module connections, in a clear vector format."

To its right is a tilted graphite-pencil icon (30 px long; grey body #7D7D7D, pink eraser #FFDDD6, thin black outline), angled 30° upward right, with a short black shadow beneath.  Above all data boxes, a faint yellow rectangle (2 pt dark-grey stroke, 10 px radius, 170 × 48 px) is partially overlain by a white cog icon (diameter 36 px, 2 pt black stroke, eight evenly spaced teeth), signifying the automated mixing process.  From the right edge of the blue rectangle, a 2 pt black flow line extends 45 px horizontally right, then turns downward for 220 px, ending in a left-pointing arrowhead. This path forms an upside-down-U enclosing the downstream instruction generation components.  Below the training row, a 30 px gap leads to a solid black bullet (diameter 14 px), beside which the text “CIRS-guided Instruction Generation” appears in black Arial Bold, 28 pt. Directly beneath, a dataset container consists of a medium-large rounded rectangle (540 × 155 px, 2 pt black stroke, 12 px radius). Inside along the top edge, three bold italic column headers (22 pt, black): “In-Distribution” (left third), “Near-Distribution” (center), and “Out-of-Distribution” (right third). Below each header is a light-blue (#DDEBFF, 230 × 100 px, no stroke) subrectangle, each with datasets:  - Left (“In-Distribution”): “AQuA”, “ASDiv”, “GSM8K”, “SVAMP” (black Arial Bold 20 pt, stacked). - Center (“Near-Distribution”): “MathQA”, “MultiArith” (black Arial Bold 20 pt, vertical). - Right (“Out-of-Distribution”): “MATH”, “Big Bench Hard”, “DeepMind Math” (vertical, bold).  On the far right edge, vertically centered beside the dataset container, a bright green circle (diameter 55 px, fill #14C742, 2 pt black stroke) contains a white right-pointing triangular play glyph. To its immediate right, “Evaluation” is written in large red Arial Bold, 28 pt, baseline aligned with the center of the play icon. The black flow arrow previously described terminates at the green circle, indicating process flow.  Above the main dataset table, a thin orange horizontal connector line (2 pt) links all three column headers, with three evenly spaced upward-pointing branch arrows (black, 2 pt) connecting to small orange circles (diameter 18 px), each labeled “CIRS” in white Arial Bold, signifying selection routing.  The lower block features a 30 px gap beneath the upper block, followed by a solid black bullet (14 px diameter), adjacent to the text “CIRS-based Code Filtering” in black Arial Bold, 28 pt.  Below, a large rounded rectangle (800 × 180 px, 4 pt black solid stroke, 12 px radius) forms the process container. Within, left-to-right:  - At the left margin, a vertical stack of two icons: a folded-corner document (80 × 60 px, 2 pt navy stroke, white fill; centered navy angled brackets “</>”), and beneath it, a small magnifying glass (diameter 36 px, 2 pt black stroke, blue lens #2FA7FF), both captionless. - Thirty-five px to the right, a black straight arrow (90 px, 2 pt stroke) points right; above shaft is lowercase black text “filter” (Arial Italic, 20 pt). - Next, an 80 × 80 px square-grid graphic, outlined 2 pt black, divided by one vertical and one horizontal solid cyan line (2 pt, #2FA7FF) into quadrants. Top-left, top-right, and bottom-left quadrants are filled light-grey (#D8D8D8); bottom-right is filled solid blue (#0D68B5). Small icons in each quadrant indicate exclusion: red “×” in grays, green checkmark in blue. - To the right, another 90 px black arrow points right. Above the arrow shaft, small italic orange text “score” (Arial Italic, 18 pt). - Next, a horizontal process chain of three light-cream rounded rectangles (#FFF3D4, 120 × 60 px each, 2 pt black stroke, 8 px radius), each spaced 25 px apart:      - First: “Code Alpaca” (centered bold black, 22 pt).     - Second: “WizardCoder” (centered bold navy, 22 pt).     - Third: “StableCode” (centered bold black, 22 pt). - Below these rectangles, a thin horizontal black line with three downward-pointing black arrowheads connects the bottoms of all three to a single large pale-blue rounded rectangle (360 × 70 px, 2 pt navy stroke, 10 px radius, fill #EEF8FF) labeled “Train / Validation / Test Split” (centered bold navy, 22 pt).  At the bottom-left interior of the dashed block, a small caption in black Arial Italic, 18 pt: “code instructions”.  All module strokes and connector lines are pure black (#000000), except for specified color accents. Arrowheads are solid black, 70° V-shape. Rounded rectangles have 8–12 px corner radii.

Along its top edge sit five evenly spaced rounded rectangles (each 80 × 35 px, pastel peach) labeled “Target explanation tokens”, each with a sequential number badge in its top-left corner.   Below the LLM box are eight light-blue (#CFE7FF) thin rectangles (110 × 45 px), symbolizing token embeddings, each with a thin upward black arrow leading into the LLM box; the leftmost and rightmost rectangles display a snowflake 🧊 and fire 🔥 in their upper-right corners, respectively.   Beneath these lies a large light-blue rounded rectangle (410 × 95 px), labeled “LLM Text Embedder” (handwritten font, left), its lower-right corner marked with a snowflake 🧊. From its left edge, the “Adapter” block (190 × 90 px, bright pastel orange #FFAB73) overlaps, with the label “Adapter”, a fire 🔥 icon in lower-right, and a thick black arrow entering from the left marked “Pooling”. A thin red upward arrow rises from its top edge into the LLM box.   Between Graph Embedding and the token embedding stream is a small light salmon rounded rectangle (110 × 60 px) with a stylized black “atom” emblem, captioned “graph token”; a short black arrow points upward from it into the third token embedding rectangle.  **Bottom Right:**   A large dashed rounded rectangle (380 × 260 px, 8 px dash / 5 px gap, 3 px stroke) contains monospaced multiline text template in black and red:    <Instruction>:    Given the following document, is it plausible that    <query description> will happen? Please answer yes, no, or unsure then explain your decision.    <Input>:    {Reasoning Chains text}    <History>:    {past predictions and explanations}    <Answer>:    {target explanation text}   A bold caption “Instruct Tuning Prompt” sits beneath the frame.  **Additional modules:**   Between the LLM and the central column, an auxiliary block labeled “Temporal Attention Mixer” (160 × 80 px, mint #B5E7D0 outline, filled light beige), with two overlapping arrow paths connecting it up into the LLM box and sideways from the Temporal Encoder.   In the bottom center, a small legend box (110 × 60 px, light grey fill, solid border) shows the snowflake and fire icons, labeled “Frozen / Trainable”.  **Arrows and Connectors:**   All arrows use thick black solid borders and pastel yellow fills except for fine-tuning routes, which are solid red. No gradient or dashed lines. All module boundaries and interconnections maintain strict, non-overlapping separation except where specifically overlapped. Arrow labels are in clear regular handwritten font (black), placed near the centerline of each arrow. All icons and tokens are sharply rendered with black outlines.  **Overall Layout:**   Each logical block is distinctly framed in dashed rounded rectangles using the specified dash and gap pattern, positioned according to the assigned column widths, separated by vertical and horizontal gutters, ensuring optimal readability and clarity. Every module, connector, icon, label, and token is distinctly and unambiguously in its indicated location, utilizing assigned pastel colors and consistent stylization. No gradients or dashed arrows are present in any part of the illustration."

Between this and the next block, a left-right horizontally aligned double-headed arrow (6 px width, 90 px) signifies data exchange.  To its right, the “Manager Agent” module dominates with a large, light-grey (#E5E5E5) cloud, 380 × 240 px, 3 px outline. Inside, sitting upper-center, is an avatar—a male figure with black-rimmed glasses, navy suit, red tie—rendered in vector flat style. Right of the avatar lies a detailed clipboard (with blue header and lined notepad details). “Manager Agent” is written beneath the figures in bold, centered, 28 pt black script. From the cloud’s right edge, a clear, directional single-arrow (6 px width, 130 px length) veers towards the central module. Below the cloud, a robust green arrow (8 px width, 60 px length) points directly to the next process.  Directly below sits the “Output” node, a fresh green (#4CAF50) rounded rectangle (260 × 90 px, 6 px radius, 3 px black outline), centered bold white “Output” text (34 pt). An avatar—a person with short hair and pale brown shirt—sits at the left within the box.  To the right, the main “MCP Creation” module occupies a horizontal, white-filled, rounded rectangle (940 × 280 px, 3 px charcoal outline), its top-left topped by a medium-grey (#AFAFAF) header bar (160 × 36 px) stating “MCP Creation” (24 pt bold black, left-aligned).  The interior is divided into three horizontally arranged zones: - “MCP Brainstorming”: at far left, a magenta-rose (#D67AC0) rounded square (230 × 230 px, 12 px radius, 3 px outline) with a central white network-topology icon overlayed by an orange wrench; a glowing yellow lightbulb sits at the top-right edge. Below, bold white caption “MCP Brainstorming” (24 pt). - “MCP Process Stack”: adjoining right, a nested pale-yellow (#FFF7D0) rounded rectangle (520 × 230 px), bounded by a 12 px deep-gold (#E0AF36) outer frame. This is vertically spaced into three bullet-point steps, each left-aligned in 24 pt dark-grey:    1. 'Open-source Searching' with a black GitHub-cat icon.   2. 'Script Generating' with a coral (#F06555) curly-brace (HTML/JS) stacked icon.   3. 'Virtual Env Execution' featuring a blue terminal-corner symbol. - At rightmost, a golden arrow (6 px width, 70 px length) traverses right to the word “Encapsulate” (22 pt black), directly followed by a small, isometric brown cardboard-box icon.  Flanking the module’s far right, the “MCP Box” appears as a purple-tint (#C4B8FF) cloud (240 × 200 px, 3 px outline) holding a dark-teal wrench and screwdriver crossed above an oval canister. Below, the caption “MCP Box” is centered in bold black, 26 pt.  Loop mechanics: From the MCP Box’s lower edge, a thick violet (#9F7AF0) arrow (8 px width) snakes leftward, tracing the container’s bottom contour, bending down then left, and connecting onto the left side of the Manager Agent cloud. At its midpoint, a label (160 × 34 px, violet border, white fill) reads “Self Evolving” (24 pt violet, centered).  Above the MCP Creation module, a small white label “CodeReAct Loop” (24 pt black, subtle light-grey shadow) is aligned with its upper edge.  At mid-right of the outer frame, a dark-grey vertical hamburger-menu icon (24 × 24 px) is placed. The bottom-right corner features a dark-grey exit/close square icon (24 × 24 px).  To expand complexity, two additional workflow modules appear on the top-right region and lower-right below the MCP Creation block: - “Data Validator” module: Above right of the MCP Box, an orange-tint (#FFC374) rounded rectangle (210 × 80 px, 4 px radius, 3 px outline) contains a magnifying glass icon over a checkmarked document. “Data Validator” in bold black (26 pt) is placed below the icon. - A thin solid orange arrow (6 px width, 50 px length) arcs downward from the Data Validator, connecting to the MCP Box.  - “Feedback Analyzer” module: Below the MCP Creation container, a cyan-blue (#79E4E5) rounded rectangle (240 × 100 px, 5 px radius, 3 px outline) sits horizontally; a central analytics dashboard icon (line graph + speech bubble) is flanked left by a bold black “Feedback Analyzer” (24 pt).  - A thick blue upward arrow (8 px width, 60 px length) rises from this module to the bottom of the MCP Creation block. - Dotted lines, matching the outline grey, connect Output node’s right edge down to Feedback Analyzer and from Feedback Analyzer’s right edge to the main frame’s lower right, with inward-pointing arrowheads, depicting continuous feedback and monitoring.  Typography throughout uses a clean sans-serif (Source Sans Pro), all icons in flat-vector style with thin (3 px) outlines. Every major block is shadowed with a soft drop-shadow (opacity 15%, blur 6 px, offset 2 px) for subtle depth, preserving clinical clarity. Each module is distinctly color-coded for function, with all arrows explicitly conveying the workflow, inner loop, and external data validation and feedback mechanisms, supporting a balanced, high-resolution academic presentation."
ti2i_image_caption_146="Portrait-oriented rectangular canvas, crisp vector style, 4:5 aspect ratio.   At the top, a wide horizontal banner spans the full width. Its background has a gentle left-to-right gradient from lavender (#dbe1ff) to pale cyan (#d4eaf0). Centered at the top of the banner, bold dark-slate-gray text (11 pt): “(b) Visually Self-Adaptive State Block (VSSB)”. The banner casts a subtle drop-shadow (4 px blur, 15% opacity, 2 px down).  Inside the banner, a left-to-right data flow is constructed with a continuous solid 2-pt black polyline with right-angled bends. There are eight main modules, each represented as a horizontally oriented rounded rectangle (radius 4 px, 1.5 pt black stroke, flat fill: module-specific color, white interior if not specified, bold 10 pt small-caps label centered):  - The sequence is:     1. “Norm” (leftmost, desaturated green #b8d4b3)     2. “Mixer” (desaturated periwinkle #9fa9d9)     3. “Gate” (pale orange #ffe7c2)     4. First ⊕ (addition, 14 px circle, 1.5 pt black border, white fill), with a vertical arrow joining from above core path     5. “Norm” (second block, same green)     6. “CAB” (light coral #f0b4b4)     7. “DropPath” (very pale blue #e1eefb)     8. Second ⊕ (rightmost, 14 px, same style), final output rightward  - Two SCALE blocks (lavender #b8b4d7, smaller rectangles) sit above the main line: one above the left path (before first ⊕), one above the right path (before second ⊕), each connected by a short vertical arrow to the corresponding point between modules.  - On the main path, between “Norm” and “Mixer”, a leftwards residual connection splits off before “Mixer” and skips directly to the first ⊕, with clear flow lines (all arrowheads are solid black triangles, same thickness).  - Between “CAB” and “DropPath” is a “SE” module (squeeze-excitation, light lemon #faecc2), inline rectangle, with a rightward arrow connecting “CAB” to “SE”, then to “DropPath”.  - All module boxes have even horizontal spacing (about 34 px), and the two SCALE blocks are vertically offset about 40 px above the main path.  Below, a bold, symmetric, solid-line black triangle (1.5 pt) gently projects downward, its base matching the full width of the upper banner, pointing towards the region below, indicating zoom-in.  The lower two-thirds of the canvas is a large thick dash-dot rectangle (stroke: 10 px dash, 5 px dot, 10 px dash, 1.8 pt), with white fill and 18 px inner padding.  This region is horizontally divided into an upper blue-toned zone (≈50% height, light sky-blue #d6ecff) and a lower pink zone (≈50% height, very pale salmon #fde7e7), separated by a medium gray (1.5 pt) horizontal line, labelled “Split On Channel” in gray sans-serif, left-aligned above the divider.  Top colored region (captioned): In the blue zone, upper left, bold dark gray 11 pt caption: “(c) DS-Mamba”.  The main signal flow begins from the left edge, midway vertically, entering as a thick solid black arrow.  The flow immediately divides:  - The main vertical trunk moves up, then horizontally right, entering a vertically stacked processing chain (centered near the top of the blue section), composed of six rounded-rectangle modules in order (12 px vertical spacing, ascending order, 1.5 pt black border, 4 px corner radius):     1. “Linear” (pale steel blue #bfd7e8)     2. “Conv” (slightly darker steel #a7c4db)     3. “SiLu” (baby-blue #bbdcee)     4. “DS-SSM” (indigo-blue #8fa1d4)     5. “Norm” (pastel light-yellowish #ececd2)     6. “Dropout” (pastel teal #c6ede8) Arrows connect each module downward (2 pt, solid black). Output from “Dropout” moves right into a ⊗ operator (circle, 14 px, stroke 1.5 pt).  - A parallel shortcut branch splits off from the initial trunk, runs horizontally right to a pair of sequential modules:     1. “Linear” (blue-gray, stacked horizontally)     2. “SiLu” (light blue #bbdcee, right of Linear)     Output then curves down into the same ⊗ as the main stack.  - After the ⊗, the signal proceeds right into a cyan (#9dd1eb) rounded rectangle labeled “Fusion Unit”. From there, a solid arrow leads right off the box, curves down outside the pink zone, rejoining a horizontal arrow fusing with the input of the bottom central Conv module in the lower zone.  Within the blue zone at top-right, a vertical dashed black arrow (2 pt dashes, above the modules) labeled “Aux Output” points upward from the “DS-SSM” module to the top border, terminating at a small rectangle labeled “Aux Head” (ivory fill, 1.5 pt black border, 9 pt bold font).  Lower pink-toned region (caption): In the bottom-left, bold dark gray 11 pt caption: “(d) idConv”.  The signal incoming from the top zone enters at the upper right of the pink area and first encounters a pre-Conv activation block, vertically stacked (centered horizontally):  - “Pre-Act” (pale rose #fbdae3), then - “Conv” (pale coral #f4bdbd).  The output curves down to join the pink central pipeline, which processes left-to-right as follows:     1. “AvgPool” (pale lavender-pink #e5c7d7)     2. Arrow to “Conv” (light coral #f6b3b3)     3. Arrow to ⊗ operator (learnable modulation) annotated with colored text “learnable” (8 pt, positioned above arrow)     4. On this arrow, a pink double grid icon (two overlaid 3×3 white-lined kernels)     5. The output enters a “Conv kernel” vertical stack (three pink translucent grids), then flows into the central “Conv” (pale coral) in the bottom row.  After the “Conv” module, the output arrow curves leftward, ascending to re-join the main DS-Mamba input near the left of the blue section, closing a long residual feedback loop that encompasses the entire lower pipeline and upper processing chain. At the rejoining point, just before entering the upper blue trunk, a “Sum” operator (⊕ in 14 px circle, 1.5 pt border, white fill) merges the residual with the main input flow.  At the lower right, a rightward arrow exits the Conv module, terminating at a small rectangle labeled “Output”, filled very pale gray, black outlined, 9 pt bold text.  All modules and operators labeled in bold uppercase (except “SiLu”, “AvgPool”, and “learnable”). Operators use ⊕ (addition), ⊗ (multiplication), each depicted in circles (14 px, 1.5 pt outline).  All arrows are solid black (2 pt). No gradients inside any module or box. All geometry is anti-aliased and lines crisp, with vector-precise placements. Font throughout is sans-serif (Helvetica/Arial family), keeping visual hierarchy by font size (modules: 9 pt, captions: 11 pt, labels: 8–9 pt).  Color palette used consistently for each module. No dashed, dotted, or gradient lines inside any processing blocks. Shadow used only on upper banner, as specified."
ti2i_image_caption_147="A wide canvas (ratio ≈ 2.2:1, 1700 × 770 px) with a flat warm parchment-yellow (#F7E7B3) background covers the full area.

ti2i_image_caption_150="The image features a white background with an aspect ratio of approximately 2.2:1. The figure is divided into a left panel occupying about 40% of the width and a right panel covering the remaining 60%. All fonts are modern sans-serif: semibold for all labels, normal weight for mathematical equations. The color palette consists of orange-brown (#C97735), sky-blue (#AFC8F4), medium-blue (#2F63B5), pastel-peach (#F5D5C2), pastel-blue (#E3ECFF), pastel-green (#9FCC9F), grey (#8E8E8E), and black for main connectors.  **Left Panel (660 px wide):**  1. The top section is a pastel-peach rectangle, 250 px tall. The top-left corner shows a flame icon (red-yellow gradient, 35 px tall) followed by the text “Top L Layers.” On the right side are two stacked, bold, orange-brown labels: “gating” above “softmax,” both right-aligned. Between them, a horizontal rightward orange arrow (100 px) ends in an orange circle (32 px diameter, 4 px stroke) with a diagonal cross (⊗). Along the bottom, the rectangle is split into three equal pastel-peach sub-blocks labeled “Adap1,” “Adap2,” and “Adap3” (left to right). Above each sub-block, dark grey curly braces indicate “H,” “M-H,” and “R,” with brace labels.  2. The middle section is a pastel-blue rectangle (250 px high) titled “Zero-init Attention” in dark-grey at top-left. In the top-right, a blue snowflake icon (35 px). Underneath, a thick horizontal orange arrow enters from the left, ending at the word “Concat.” (dark grey) beside a black circle (⊕, 32 px diameter, 4 px stroke) with plus. Below, a large navy “softmax” word is centered. Beneath this, a rounded pastel-blue rectangle labeled “Extended Sequence Prompt,” followed by a horizontal pale-grey double-headed arrow labeled “K+R.”  3. The bottom section is a pastel-blue rectangle (200 px high). Top-right, snowflake icon (35 px). Centered label “Bottom N-L Layers” in dark grey. Centered beneath, blue “softmax.” Below, a row of 7 thin vertical light-grey rectangles evenly spaced, representing tokens; the three center ones are heavily faded, flanked by “⋯” (black, centered between faded tokens). Grey double-headed arrow below the tokens, labeled “K.”  4. At the extreme bottom-left below the stack, an expanded legend presents three inline icon-text pairs: flame icon + “Fine-tune” (orange), snowflake icon + “Frozen” (blue), and a new lock icon + “Regularized” (grey). Below, bold black text “Input Sequence.”  **Right Panel (~1050 px wide), contained by a solid medium-blue rounded border (4 px, 20 px radius):** The border starts just above the mid-height of the 'Zero-init' box on the left panel and encloses all right panel contents.  **Bottom row (Key–Value Inputs):** Three main horizontally aligned blocks, each 75 px tall: - Left: Q (square pastel-blue, 100 × 75 px). - Middle group: k₁ (pastel-peach, 60 × 75 px), k₂ (pastel-peach, 60 × 75 px), k₃ (pastel-peach, 60 × 75 px), K_vanilla (pastel-blue, 140 × 75 px), all adjacent with 1 px black gaps. - Right group: v₁ (peach), v₂ (peach), v₃ (peach), V_vanilla (blue), matching the sizes and arrangement of their respective K blocks. Directly below, italic grey equation: “Q∈ℝ^{K×C}  K,V∈ℝ^{(K+H+(M−H)+R)×C}.”  **Middle row (Softmax Attention Module):** Above the key blocks, a white rounded rectangle outlined in medium-blue (500 × 130 px). Centered inside: black equation “softmax(Q Kᵀ / √dₖ).” A thick upward medium-blue arrow leads from Q block into the module. Two thick medium-blue arrows emerge from the left and right edges of the K blocks into this module.  **Top-left (Combined Score Tensor):** Directly above the softmax module, a white rounded rectangle outlined with a dotted medium-blue stroke (3 px, 12 px dash, 6 px gap), forming an envelope containing four vertically concatenated blocks: - S_vanilla (left, pastel-blue, 120 × 120 px); below: label “K” with horizontal grey double-headed arrow of same width. - S₃ (light pastel-peach, 70 px wide). - S₂ (pastel-peach, 70 px wide). - S₁ (deeper pastel-peach, 70 px wide). A horizontal light-grey double-headed arrow runs above the full bar, labeled “K+(M−H)+H+R.” A thick blue vertical arrow connects the softmax module to S_vanilla. From the right of S₁, a black horizontal connector moves to the next stage, with an orange circle (⊗, 32 px diameter, 4 px stroke) with “gating” arrow entering from left (orange-brown). From above, a thin downward grey arrow marked “regularizer” enters the right edge of S₁.  **Gated Representation & Loss Nodes:** At the crossing of the black horizontal line and the orange ⊗, the line continues to a solid black circle (60 px diameter) labeled X_G (italic, center). Above, a red hammer icon strikes the circle, and to its right curved black text reads “L_causal.” Beneath X_G, a grey lock icon is attached via a short vertical line, labeled “L_reg” (italic, small, dark grey).  **Output to Next Layer:** From X_G, the black line continues rightward, then turns up as a thick black vertical arrow reaching a row of 8 small green rectangles (vector Z) forming a horizontal strip (360 × 45 px). Upward from Z, a solid black arrow (25 px) exits the border, faint grey label “Next layer.”  **Top-right Caption:** Inside the top edge of the border, in grey italics: “Top L′ Layers.”  **Connectors and Misc:** All arrows are thick (4 px) with solid heads; “gating” arrows orange-brown, “softmax” arrows medium-blue, main dataflow arrows black. All math symbols (Q, K, V, subscripts, roots) are italic serif. Snowflake icon: six-arm fractal, colored #2F63B5, 35 px. The flame and lock icons, all sized 35 px. All borders are solid except where dotted as specified."
ti2i_image_caption_151="The image is a detailed 2-D schematic hardware-block diagram in IEEE/ACM style, sized 1140 × 768 px in landscape orientation, with a thick (3 px) black outline framing the figure and a 10-px margin from the canvas edge. The background is white. All module boxes have rounded corners (4 px radius). There are two primary color fills: pastel light-blue (RGB #CCE0FF) for “data/control path” modules and pale pastel beige/yellow (RGB #FFF0CC) for “scale-up only” modules.  At the top left, the italicized and underlined title “Accumulate Config. Logic” appears in 11 pt black font, 10 px from the upper canvas boundary. Beneath it, the “Accumulate Config. Register” light-blue module (138 × 54 px) is positioned with its left edge 10 px from the canvas border and spaced 25 px under the title. Its text is centered in two lines.  Rightward from it, a “BP module” light-blue box (110 × 32 px) sits 22 px away, connected by a solid black arrow. Below “BP module”, the “CapacityCounter” module (140 × 36 px, light-blue) is horizontally centered and connected by a downward arrow from the BP module. To its left, a circular blue “+” icon (diameter 26 px, cyan-blue outline, blue plus symbol) is placed; a black arrow enters its left, originating from a circular “–” icon below (same style, 70 px lower). The “–” icon sends a rightward arrow into the lower input of a vertical 3-input multiplexer (slim light-grey trapezoid, 20 × 110 px, with left-side input labels “0”, “1”, “2” in 8 pt Arial, output on right side), which now receives arrows from “+” (top), “–” (middle), and a new input labeled “Overflow” (bottom) from a new module below.  The new “Overflow Detector” module (light-blue rounded rectangle, 120 × 30 px) is placed below the “–” icon, 30 px lower, with an outgoing upward arrow into the multiplexer’s “Overflow” input and an incoming leftward arrow originating from the right edge of “SumCandidateCounter”.  The multiplexer output arrow enters the “SumCandidateCounter” module (light-blue, 180 × 36 px) located 20 px to the right. “SumCandidateCounter” has an outgoing rightward arrow that bifurcates: one branch wraps clockwise as a C-shaped path to feed the “Sub-SumCandidateCounter” box below; the other branch flows into the “Threshold Comparator” module (light-blue rounded rectangle, 118 × 32 px) placed 35 px right and slightly above, which receives an additional up arrow labeled “Threshold Set” from a small circular “Threshold” icon (26 px diameter, blue outline, bold “T” in blue). The “Threshold Comparator” outputs a downward arrow to a new “Error Logger” module (light-blue, 110 × 28 px), which has a rightward arrow that exits into the dashed region.  The bottom 42% of the canvas (from y = 250 px to y = 720 px) is enclosed with a 6 px dashed black rectangle, denoting the “Scale-Up Only” region and spanning full canvas width (left margin aligned at x = 0 px). The left side of this region features vertically rotated bold black text “Scale-Up Only” (12 pt), centered relative to the dashed edge.  Within this region, at top-left (25 px offset), the “Sub-SumCandidateCounter” box (beige, 200 × 36 px) resides. An upward arrow from “SumCandidateCounter” wraps clockwise into its top. Its outgoing rightward arrow enters the “Forward Controller” module (beige, 210 × 44 px), which is positioned at the right margin, vertically centered between the two boxes. “Forward Controller” receives a second upward arrow labeled “FS[1]/[2].CNV” from outside the dashed region.  Beneath “Sub-SumCandidateCounter” (60 px lower), the “Scheduler” box (beige, 180 × 48 px) is left-aligned. Below this, a short vertical tail displays left-justified 8 pt text: “FS[1]/[2].Sub-SumCandidateCounter”. The “Scheduler” sends a rightward arrow labeled “S0” to “Sub-SumCandidateCounter” (arrow passes through the dashed boundary) and a downward arrow into the new beige “Process Monitor” module (160 × 30 px) directly below, which possesses a rightward outgoing arrow into a slim vertical “Status Distributor” (beige trapezoid, 24 × 70 px), outputting arrows to both “Forward Controller” and “Error Logger” (reaching outside the dashed region).  A new vertical slim blue module labeled “Audit Tracker” (light-blue rectangle, 26 × 80 px, right-aligned on the dashed region) is placed directly left of “Forward Controller”, and receives two incoming arrows: downward from the “Threshold Comparator” and leftward from the “Status Distributor”.  On the right half, at the top, “Accumulate Config. Register” title (italicized, underlined, 11 pt black) is placed at x ≈600 px, y =10 px. Below it, the “Accumulate Config. Register Table” (beige, 370 × 140 px, thick black (2 px) border) is present. The title row “Total Capacity” spans the width. The second header row has four columns (instead of three): “Sum Tag” (80 px), “Sum Address” (180 px), “SumCandidate Count” (86 px), “Audit Status” (24 px). There are now three data rows:   Row 1: “1 | 0X0000B55 | 6 | ✓”   Row 2: “2 | 0X0021FA6 | 123 | –”   Row 3: “3 | 0X01AB332 | 512 | !”   All cells are centered, 9 pt Arial regular.  To the right of the table, a vertical stack of two color legend boxes (each 92 × 22 px), lightly outlined in black, titled “Legend” at the top: first box filled pastel light-blue, labeled “Config/Data Path”; second filled pastel beige/yellow, labeled “Scale-Up Only”. Blue outlined icon circles (“+”, “–”, “T”) are shown at left of legend, each labeled “Increment”, “Decrement”, “Threshold”.  All arrowheads in the diagram are solid black triangles. Mathematical icons (“+”, “–”, “T”) are inside blue circle outlines of 2 px width. All module, table, and legend box outlines are solid lines; no gradients, no dashes except for the “Scale-Up Only” boundary.  Resolution is 300 dpi, precise vector output suitable for PDF/SVG."
ti2i_image_caption_152="A white canvas, 3500 × 700 px, enclosed by a solid 2 pt black border. At the left edge, a tall rectangle labeled “Fabric Switch” (32 pt italic, underlined), 480 px wide, with 12 px inner margin. Inside, two vertically stacked rounded rectangles: top labeled “Egress Queue”, bottom labeled “Ingress Queue” with a right-aligned sub-caption “from USP” (22 pt grey). Each queue block measures 350 px × 110 px, separated by 45 px vertical gap. Both blocks connect rightward: a 160 px horizontal black arrow from Egress Queue and a 140 px arrow from Ingress Queue, the latter feeding into a left-side multiplexer.  The left multiplexer is an isosceles right triangle (base 80 px, height 120 px), apex to the right, filled light-steel-blue (#c8d8ef) and outlined black. Inside, stacked numerals “0” and “1” (22 pt, upper/low left). Beneath the apex, label “S0” (20 pt italic). A 120 px black output arrow runs rightward, splitting to two horizontally aligned white blocks: above, “Instruction Repacking”; below, “MemOpcode Checker”; each 260 px wide, 100 px high, separated by 15 px vertical gap.  Above these two blocks, a wide rounded rectangle labeled “VCS” (630 px × 140 px), top aligned to Egress Queue’s mid-height. From VCS’s right edge, a dashed-black control arrow curves upward then right (radius 70 px, horizontal length 420 px) into the left edge of the “Process Core” block. A solid lavender arrow exits VCS’s upper-right, moves up 90 px, then right into the same “Process Core” entry.  Centered near the top of the canvas (~60 % from left), “Process Core” is a light-beige (#f8e4c8) rounded rectangle, 520 px × 135 px, labeled bold center. From its right edge, a red dotted arrow (3 pt, 10 px dot, 6 px gap) travels 500 px horizontally into the next block.  To the right, a large grey rectangle (“On Switch Buffer”, 620 px × 155 px, spaced 40 px right of canvas border), holding two centered lines: first bold, second italic, “SRAM: 32 KB ~ 1 MB”.  Directly under Process Core, a straight solid red line (3 pt), labeled just above as “Bypass Path” (22 pt italic), runs horizontally across the diagram, passing through an overlay area and terminating at the right multiplexer. The overlay area, “FM Endpoint Extension”, is a translucent pale-pink rectangle (from 50 px left of Instruction Repacking’s right edge to 50 px left from the right canvas border; vertically, from 35 px below Instruction Repacking down to 40 px below Memory Indexing). At the top border, centered, small italic “FM Endpoint Extension” (20 pt).  Within the overlay, three core modules. Upper: “Migration Controller”, steel-grey rectangle (360 px × 105 px), left-aligned 30 px after MemOpcode Checker’s right edge. To its immediate left, a vertical stack icon of three dark-grey parallelograms (50 px × 14 px, 10 px gap). Below, two horizontally arranged rounded rectangles—left: “Address Profiler”, right: “Memory Indexing”, each 330 px × 95 px, 20 px gap. Black connector arrows link: from MemOpcode Checker to Address Profiler, then Address Profiler to Memory Indexing. The Bypass Path runs straight above and touches Migration Controller’s right edge, feeding the right-side multiplexer.  The right multiplexer, a mirror of the left triangle (80 px base, 120 px height, apex left, filled light-steel-blue), sits 90 px right of Memory Indexing. Inside, “0” upper-right, “1” lower-right (22 pt). An upward black arrow from the “0” input returns to On Switch Buffer’s lower edge. A downward black arrow from the apex, labeled “to DSP” (22 pt italic), exits canvas at bottom.  Below FM Endpoint Extension, a third module row: three side-by-side rounded rectangles (each 320 px × 90 px, 20 px gaps). Leftmost is “Security Filter”, central is “Power State Monitor”, rightmost is “Error Logger”. Each has a unique icon at their left: a shield for Security Filter (black), a battery for Power State Monitor (black outline), a warning triangle for Error Logger (black). Each module receives a vertical black arrow from its respective block above; horizontal black connectors link these modules in sequence left to right.  Above Process Core, a small rectangular block, “Debug Controller” (240 px × 60 px), light-blue fill, outlined black. A dashed-black control arrow descends from Debug Controller into Process Core. To its upper-right, a black circle (28 px diameter) labeled “Clk” (24 pt), with a curved black arrow entering the top-right corner of Process Core.  To the left of VCS, a tall rounded rectangle “Sync Arbiter” (220 px × 85 px, light-grey fill), with a vertical dashed-black arrow entering VCS’s left edge. From VCS’s left-top, a lavender arrow splits diagonally up and left to connect with a small circle labeled “TRIG” (18 px diameter, black outline).  All rounded rectangles have 15 px corner radius. All elements, lines, and arrows conform to a 12 px baseline grid. There are no gradients, shadows, or 3-D effects. All fonts are bold, condensed, sans-serif (labels 26 pt, sub-captions 22 pt, remarks italic 20 pt). Arrows are solid 3 pt except dashed control paths. Selector triangles filled light-steel-blue; module fills pure-white unless specified. All elements maintain at least 40 px horizontal clearance from neighbors. The diagram is fully vector, text selectable."
ti2i_image_caption_153="A landscape-oriented scientific vector diagram with a white background and a thin solid black rectangular outer frame encloses all content. The title “Process Core Extensions” is at the top-left, italicized, underlined, flush with the left border, and positioned approximately 4 px below the top boundary in Arial, 14 pt black font.  On the far left, about 40 % down from the top and 5 % from the left border, a rounded-rectangle with 8 px corner radius represents the “To On Switch Buffer”. The block is sized at 18 % width and 25 % height of the total canvas, filled with very light pastel blue (#d5e6ff), and has a solid black 2 px border. Centered inside are two lines in bold black, 11 pt font: “To” (line one) and “On Switch Buffer” (line two). Immediately beneath and horizontally aligned, a smaller rounded-rectangle (same fill and border), 60 % the buffer’s width and 35 % its height, is labeled “Async. Flag” (centered, bold, 10 pt).  Directly to the right with a 2 % horizontal gap is the “Accumulate Reg/Logic” block, a rounded-rectangle, 25 % width and 28 % height, pastel butter fill (#fff2cf), solid black 2 px border.

The left two-thirds is a translucent sky-blue rectangle for the Cognition branch, and the right two-thirds is a translucent lavender rectangle for the Perception branch. A pale beige strip runs across the top, spanning the full width and labelled “Training” in red at the top-left; beside it, a pale mint-green strip of equal height is right-aligned and labelled “Inferring” in red at the top-right.  At the bottom left corner, there is a white rectangular box with a black 1-pt border containing the caption “the horse with white pattern on its forehead”. Above this, a pastel yellow (#F9D976) rounded rectangle labelled “NSC Aug.” connects to the text box below by a thin black vertical arrow. To the right, a rightwards black horizontal arrow links the yellow rectangle to the centre base of the sky-blue zone.  Centrally at the bottom, three photographic thumbnails are shown in a row. The leftmost is a 64×64 px image labelled beneath in italic as “I_low”. The center is an 80×80 px image labelled “I_mid” beneath, and the rightmost is 96×96 px, labelled “I_high” beneath, in italic. Each thumbnail is separated by equal spacing. A vertical black arrow rises from the base of both the 'I_high' and 'I_mid' thumbnails, splitting just above into two lines. One feeds the base of the Hierarchical Encoder in the lavender zone, while the other diverts to a new module.  Above the yellow NSC Aug. box and within the blue zone, a wide light-steel-blue (#B0D4EE) rounded rectangle labelled “V-L Pretrain Encoder” occupies most of the horizontal width. Above its left third, four small green vertical rectangles labelled “f_t” appear in a row; above its right third, four small salmon-pink vertical rectangles labelled “f_v” in a row. Above its centre, a third set of four small blue-gray rectangles, labelled “f_s”, are placed. Three black arrows, from NSC Aug., from “I_low”, and from “I_mid” (via a splitting vertical line), enter the bottom of V-L Pretrain Encoder.  To the right of the V-L Pretrain Encoder, inside the lavender Perception branch zone, is a wide medium-purple (#AF93D8) rounded rectangle labelled “Hierarchical Encoder”. On its right extremity, an indigo snowflake icon is displayed. Directly below and to its right, outside the lavender zone, the word “Freezed” in black italic appears, with another indigo snowflake icon next to it.  Centrally above the V-L Pretrain Encoder, inside the blue zone, is a wide cornflower blue (#6FACD9) rounded rectangle labelled “Cognition Decoder”. Directly above the Hierarchical Encoder is a matching-width light-purple (#C5A5E1) rounded rectangle labelled “Perception Decoder”. Inside the Perception Decoder, a 3D block-diagram icon (four gray squares stacked in perspective, decreasing in size left to right) is placed slightly left of centre. Its input arrow, labelled “f_h”, rises from the Hierarchical Encoder. To the right portion inside the Perception Decoder, a second, similar block icon (four blue-gray squares, decreasing size) is placed, labelled “f_g”.  Between and slightly overlapping the Cognition Decoder and Perception Decoder is a white rounded rectangle (gray 1-pt border) labelled “Loopback Synergy”, horizontally centred. Inside, two thick curved arrows are present: the top arrow curves from the right side back to the left (hex #D43F3A red), and the bottom one curves from the left side back to the right (hex #4096D0 blue), forming a closed loop. On the left outer edge of the rectangle, four mini salmon-pink squares, vertically stacked and labelled “q_c”; on the right outer edge, four mini light-purple squares labelled “q_p”. On the top edge, three mini green squares labelled “q_s” are centered. Directly below the synergy block, two chevron labels appear: left-pointing light-blue chevrons with “≪ Cognition Branch”; right-pointing light-purple chevrons with “Perception Branch ≫”.  Above the decoders, in the beige “Training” strip, a pale-yellow (#F8E9C7) rounded rectangle labelled “Mask Matcher” is centered vertically. From its bottom edge, two thin downward black arrows feed into the Cognition Decoder (left, labelled “P_nr”) and Perception Decoder (right, labelled “P_ref”). Three upward black arrows, labelled “L_nr”, “L_ref”, “L_mask”, exit the top of “Mask Matcher”. To the right, in the mint-green “Inferring” strip, a pastel-green (#B7E3B7) rounded rectangle labelled “Mask Filter” is aligned with Mask Matcher. One left-pointing black arrow (labelled “T_mask”) connects Mask Matcher to Mask Filter. From Mask Filter’s bottom edge, one downward black arrow labelled “P_mask” enters a new small white rounded rectangle (gray border), labelled “Result Aggregator”. From Mask Filter’s top, an upward black arrow labelled “P_mask” exits.  All modules are rendered as solid pastel-filled, rounded rectangles. All text is black, 10-pt Helvetica unless otherwise indicated.

At the bottom edge, a color icon bar of five equally spaced 88 × 88 px icons with no borders: 1) dark-blue and violet network-graph schematic with teal lines, 2) video-game controller (grey, colored buttons), 3) Minecraft-style pickaxe striking a block, 4) browser window with code symbols “< />” and arrow cursor, 5) cloud with gear (white and cyan, gear in green).  Directly below the icon bar, centered, is a 60 px icon: robot arm reaching to manipulate a green 3D cube. In the lower right corner, a tiny red warning triangle icon (12 px) is present.  All modules and decorative lines use strictly solid fills and strokes (no gradients, no dashed lines except as described for separators), and utilize only the prescribed palette: white, black, #008080, #d6ecff, #8a2be2, #ff1c1c, #ff7a00, #26b524, #00a2ff, with occasional addition of light grey (#ededed) and accent colors from icons."
ti2i_image_caption_159="The canvas has an aspect ratio of 16:9, measuring approximately 1300 px by 700 px, with a soft pink (#FAD1D1) background filling the entire area. A solid black rounded rectangle (corner radius 12 px, stroke 4 px) neatly frames the canvas. The image uses heavy, black, comic-style handwritten font (“Comic Neue Bold” equivalent) throughout: main titles are 44 pt, region titles 34 pt, internal labels 30 pt, captions 26 pt.  At the top left corner inside the border is a bright red rounded rectangle tag, 150 px by 60 px, with a 4 px black border and the word “Attack” in centered bold white text.  The diagram is divided into three regions by two solid black lines: a vertical line at 60% of canvas width and a horizontal line at 60% height, both 4 px thick. Four quadrants are formed (upper-left, upper-right, lower full-width region).  The upper-left region is titled “Jailbreak”, centered near its top edge in solid black text. At the top of the quadrant are three horizontally aligned input boxes, each 260 px by 60 px, red border and white fill: the leftmost box reads “Benign Prompt” (black text), the middle box reads “Jailbreak Prompt” (black text), and the rightmost box reads “Obfuscated Prompt” (black text, border red-violet #A035C6).  Directly 100 px below, three output boxes aligned horizontally, same size, same style. Leftmost output is labeled “Normal Ourput” (mistyped intentionally, green #00A000 border and text); center output reads “Malicious Output” (dark red #B00000 border and text); rightmost output says “Stealth Output” (purple #A035C6 border and text). A green vertical arrow (90 px) connects “Benign Prompt” to “Normal Ourput”, aligned center. To the left of this arrow is the label “Safe Guards” (black, 30 pt). Centred above the green arrow are two shield icons (40 px high) flanking a ChatGPT swirl logo (45 px diameter, green base with white swirls). A red curved arrow (5 px thick, triangular head) starts from the lower-right of “Jailbreak Prompt”, curves under the shield icons, and points at “Malicious Output”. To the right of this arrow, vertically centered, is “Bypass Guards” (black, 30 pt). A violet curved arrow (5 px thick, triangular head) starts from the lower-right of “Obfuscated Prompt”, curves under the right shield and points to “Stealth Output”. Above this arrow, vertically centered, is the label “Evade Detection” (black, 30 pt). Directly below all outputs, a small white rectangle (160 px × 40 px, black border) contains the caption “Audit Failed” (red, 26 pt).  The upper-right region is titled “Prompt Injection” in bold, centered along the upper edge. This quadrant contains four horizontal rows, spaced 40 px apart: — Top row: three small white rectangles (each 90 px × 45 px, black border), labeled “Data” in black, left/right aligned and one centered between them. — Second row: large red rectangle centered (320 px wide × 60 px tall, text “Harmful Prompt” in red #C00000). — Third row: three identical “Data” rectangles, horizontally aligned as above. — Fourth row: at far right, a database icon (three stacked cylinders; top cyan, middle green, bottom yellow, with 4 px black outline), with a bug icon (black insect, six red legs, red dot) perched on top. Green arrows (5 px thick, triangular heads) flow from each “Data” box of rows 1 and 3 into the Harmful Prompt rectangle, merging at its side. The Harmful Prompt has multiple outputs: a thick dark-red arrow leads from its right edge to the top port of the database icon. This red arrow is annotated along its length with 'Poisoned Data' (black, 28 pt). Below the database, a thick dark-red arrow goes leftwards into a large 75 px ChatGPT swirl logo (purple base/white swirl), positioned lower-centre of the quadrant. Sitting atop the database and the ChatGPT icon, place small bug icons (legs showing). A right-pointing dark-red arrow links the ChatGPT swirl to a white rectangle (180 px × 48 px, black border) labeled “Corrupted Output” (dark red text). Above and to the right of the Harmful Prompt rectangle, place a 60 px attacker icon (blue hoodie, red padlock, black outline), with the label “Threat Actor” (black, 30 pt) directly beneath.  The lower region is titled “Backdoor”, aligned left just below the horizontal line. On the far left, a white rectangle (100 px × 55 px, black border), labeled “Data” in black, bug icon overlapping its upper-left corner. To its right (distance 250 px) is a large ChatGPT swirl logo (70 px diameter), with caption underneath “Benign LLM”. A thick red arrow (5 px) points right from “Data” to Benign LLM. A thick black arrow (150 px, 5 px) points right from Benign LLM into a similar ChatGPT swirl logo (70 px) with a bug icon overlapping the top-left; caption underneath “Backdoor LLM”. Above Backdoor LLM, a small white rectangle (200 px × 45 px, 3 px red border) contains the text “Query w/ backdoor” (black). A short red arrow (60 px, 5 px) points from the rectangle’s right edge into Backdoor LLM. To the right of Backdoor LLM (distance 160 px), place a blue attacker icon (70 px, hoodie, red padlock, black outline) with “Attacker” label in black, 30 pt above it. A thick red arrow (200 px, 5 px) flows rightward from Backdoor LLM to a large white rectangle (280 px × 60 px, border red), with text “Malicious behaviours” (black). Directly below, place a yellow warning triangle (60 px side, thick black border, with black exclamation mark) and a caption below “System Compromised” (red, 28 pt). To the right of the “Malicious behaviours” box, a database icon (three stacked cylinders, colored as above, 4 px outline) is shown with a bug icon on top. From its base, draw a black arrow (120 px) pointing down to a white rectangle (170 px × 38 px, border black) labeled “Log Tampered” (black).  All arrows align to the vertical centers of their source and target boxes. Boxes within each horizontal row share a common baseline. Vertical spacing between groups is 120 px. Modules, icons, lines, borders, and arrows have solid fills, bold outlines, and no gradients or dashed strokes."
ti2i_image_caption_160="The image features a rectangular canvas sized approximately 1800 × 1040 px (aspect ratio 16:9) with a very light desaturated blue background (RGB #D4E5FF). The canvas is bordered by a 6 px thick medium steel-blue rounded rectangle (radius 25 px), inset 18 px from all four edges.  At the top left corner, a horizontal rounded rectangle ribbon (360 px × 90 px, radius 25 px) in vivid royal-blue (#0F6BFF) is anchored flush to the frame, positioned 20 px from the top and left edges. Centered within the ribbon is the word “Evaluation” in large white bold font, approx. 52 pt.  Directly below the ribbon, two horizontal zone labels are positioned at y ≈ 150 px. On the left, “Focused Assessment” appears in bold black 42 pt, left-aligned to the frame. To the right, and split by the vertical axis, “General Benchmark” is written in bold black 42 pt. Between these zones, a vertical dashed black line (4 px stroke, dash segments of 20 px length and 20 px gaps) runs from y ≈ 120 px to y ≈ 880 px at the midpoint of the canvas width.  Centrally located on the canvas is a purple circular emblem (diameter 170 px, RGB #A882FF) featuring the white OpenAI swirl glyph.  On the left and right sides of the central emblem, two cartoonish robotic gripper icons are symmetrically positioned. Each robot hand measures 160 px × 110 px, with three cyan fingers and a cyan half-arch wrist, highlighted by metallic shading and a small yellow sleeve at the base. The left hand is placed so its rightmost edge is 40 px left of the dashed boundary line, vertically aligned with the emblem’s center. The right hand, mirrored horizontally, sits 40 px right of the boundary, sharing vertical alignment with the left.  Each robot hand features a black inward-pointing arrow (140 px in length, 4 px stroke) originating from the hand's inner side, directing toward and touching the edge of the central purple circle.  On the Focused Assessment (left) side, four vertically stacked white task rectangles are present, each with 2 px black borders and filled pure white. From top to bottom, they are labeled “Vision,” “Audio,” “Text,” and “Language,” all in black 36 pt text. Each rectangle measures 180 × 80 px. The stack is positioned 160 px left of the left robot, with the “Vision” rectangle vertically centered on the robot, and the other three rectangles above and below it with 40 px vertical spacing between each. Black connector lines extend horizontally from the right edge of each rectangle to the left edge of the robot hand.  On the General Benchmark (right) side, four white rectangles (180 × 80 px, black 36 pt text) are stacked at equal intervals. From top to bottom, they are “Code,” “Math,” “Vision,” and “Reasoning.” The “Code” rectangle is centered 120 px above the right robot, connected by a downward sloping 45° black line; “Math” is horizontally level with the robot, 220 px to its right, joined by a straight horizontal line; “Vision” is centered 120 px below the robot, linked by an upward sloping 45° black line; “Reasoning” is anchored 220 px further right of “Math,” connected by a straight horizontal line to “Math.”  From the bottom edge of the central emblem, a vertical black arrow (160 px) leads down to the top of a large white output rectangle, 260 × 100 px (corner radius 18 px), centered below the swirl. Inside the rectangle, “Output” is written in bold black 42 pt font, centered.  Below the output rectangle are two semicircular evaluation gauges, placed symmetrically. Each gauge is a 2D semicircular dial (radius 140 px, thickness 26 px) consisting of three colored arcs: the left third is red (#E54848), the center is orange (#F49C45), and the right third is green (#3CB566). A grey needle points near the boundary between the green and orange arcs. Above each gauge, three gold five-point stars (#FFC833, 48 px across) are staggered slightly. Each gauge is aligned so its center is exactly 220 px left (for the left gauge) or right (for the right gauge) of the output rectangle’s center, vertically aligned with its mid-height. Beneath each dial, the label “Evaluate” appears in bold black 36 pt font, with the baseline 40 px below the dial.  Connecting the output rectangle and both gauges, two thick horizontal black arrows (4 px stroke, filled arrowheads) extend outward from either side of the output rectangle, with each arrow pointing to the center base of the adjacent gauge.  The overall style is playful yet professional, employing vivid colors from the specified palette. All connectors except the diagonal task links on the right are perfectly straight. All module borders and arrows are pure black, with no gradients or dashed lines outside the central vertical divider. No drop shadows or patterns are present. All fonts are handwritten sans serif (“Comic Neue” or similar), bold for titles, regular for labels and body text. Spacing between modules is consistent, ensuring clear organization and separation."
ti2i_image_caption_161="The canvas is a horizontal rectangle with a 3:1 width-to-height ratio, approximately 1920×600 px. The background is light-grey (#F2F2F2). All content is contained within a 6-px thick rounded rectangle (corner radius 18 px, stroke #4D4D4D), leaving a 12-px margin on every side.  Vertically, the figure is divided into a left panel occupying 25% of the width and a right panel filling the remaining 75%. A solid black vertical line, 4 px thick, runs the full height along the division.  LEFT PANEL (“Tool Documentation”): The top-left features a large, bold, comic-style hand-written font title: “Tool Documentation”, pure black, 44 pt.

ti2i_image_caption_162="A horizontally oriented scientific diagram (approximate aspect ratio 16:9, dimensions ~1200 px by 650 px) features two subfigures, (a) on the left and (b) on the right, both aligned to a common baseline against a white background. All module outlines and text are pure black at medium thickness (2 px), with bold comic-style, sans-serif, hand-written text. A visually clear gap separates the two subfigures.  Subfigure (a) – left side, titled at top left “(a) Random mask token”   At the top, a horizontal row of eight evenly-spaced, light-grey perfectly square input tokens (size ~25 px, spacing ~6 px). Below positions 3 and 6, two large, thick, black “X” marks denote masked tokens, occupying the same horizontal positions, slightly below the token row. Below the input row, two stacked pastel trapezoid modules: the upper module is a wide lavender isosceles trapezoid labeled and centered in two lines, “Mamba” and “Encoder”; directly beneath, a narrower, pale-blue trapezoid labeled “Noise Filter”. From the base of the “Noise Filter” block, a vertical solid black arrow points downward to the colored latent-token row. The latent-token row consists of seven rounded squares (identical size as input tokens) in a horizontal chain: from left to right, dark-maroon (#6c1d12), brick-red (#b73225), crimson (#e2574d), a light blue (#8bbadf) with a dot-pattern fill, two hatch-pattern squares (45° diagonal black lines over white), ochre-yellow (#dca940), pale-orange (#f1c15b). Below this chain, a solid black vertical arrow points downward to a light-grey upside-down trapezoid labeled “Image Decoder”; beneath this block, a straight horizontal arrow extends rightward, labeled at the tip “Segment Selector”. Immediately below, two small rectangular modules, side-by-side: a pastel-green block labeled “Token Verification” (left), and a pastel-pink block labeled “Context Recovery” (right).    Subfigure (b) – right side, title at top center split in two stacked lines: “(b) Selective Structure State Space” above “Sequence Token-interpolation (TOKI)”   At the top, a row of eight evenly-spaced, light-grey square input tokens of equal size, with identical “X” marks below positions 3 and 6. Beneath, the layout divides into TWO parallel pipelines, left and right, each containing: two stacked encoder blocks, forming the “Hybrid Encoder”. The lower trapezoid block in each pipeline is cream (#f6eac6), labeled “Sparse Conv”; the upper block is lavender (#c6b4ec), labeled “Mamba”. Vertical solid black arrows descend from each encoder stack to the latent-token area. The latent tokens form a continuous chain of seven colored, rounded squares, arranged identically to subfigure (a): leftmost is dark-maroon (#6c1d12), then brick-red (#b73225), crimson (#e2574d), light blue (#8bbadf) with a dot-pattern fill, two hatch-pattern squares, ochre-yellow, and pale-orange (#f1c15b). Surrounding this token chain is a thick black rounded rectangle (corner radius 8 px, solid outline), filling only the row’s immediate area. Between every adjacent pair of colored latent tokens, bright orange (#f8a14a) curved solid arrows arc slightly upward, pointing right, representing “Token-interpolation”. Above the token chain, centered, a smaller label “Token-interpolation”. Two solid vertical black arrows rise from positions under the first and last token in the colored row, leading to two evenly spaced, identical, light-grey upside-down trapezoid “Image Decoder” blocks. Each decoder block has its own upward arrow indicating output flow. Directly above and between the decoders is a medium-sized pastel-yellow circular module labeled “Consensus Computation”, with short horizontal arrows leading from both decoders into the circle. From the circle, a single upward arrow points to a pale-blue rounded rectangle labeled “Final Output”. On the bottom right of the encoder stack, vertically aligned and rotated 90° clockwise, a small label reads “Hybrid Encoder”. Below the entire subfigure (b), a legend area contains four small horizontally arranged colored squares matching the latent token color scheme, each labeled beneath with their respective color name and purpose (e.g. “Structure”, “Detail”, “Mask”, “Interpolation”).    The overall figure has ample negative space, all module blocks aligned and clearly separated, and no crowding. All fills are solid, flat colors without gradient or dashed patterns except for the specified hatch and dot fills inside certain latent tokens. All arrows are solid black, outlines use consistent stroke width, text is black and bold, and token/decoder/encoder vertical stacks are precisely aligned."
ti2i_image_caption_163="The illustration presents a horizontally-oriented canvas with a 3:1 aspect ratio, bordered by a 25 px white margin. The layout is divided into five vertical regions, separated by thin 1 pt mid-gray (#999999) lines.  On the far left, the Input Image column (17% width) shows a square image of a green grassy background with a horizontally placed fish featuring golden scales and a dark lateral line. A 3 × 3 white grid (2 pt lines) overlays the image, dividing it into nine squares. Beneath, “Input Image” appears in bold black 11 pt Arial, flush left.  Next, the Patch Embed column (6% width) displays a vertically centered hot-pink (#ff3faa) tall rounded rectangle (90% column height, 4 px radius, border 20% darker than fill). Inside, “Patch Embed” is stacked vertically in bold white 11 pt Arial rotated 90° clockwise. Right of the rectangle, three vertical dotted columns of 10 × 10 px squares are stacked. The upper column for Virtual Vertices alternates bright red, orange, and yellow. The lower column for Hyperedges alternates teal, royal-blue, and navy. Bracket labels on the left (italic 9 pt black Arial) indicate “Virtual Vertices” and “Hyperedges”.  The central region (HgVT Block ×L, 55% width, 85% height) is a large rounded rectangle with 4 px corner radius, 2 pt medium-gray stroke, and light-gray (#eef0f3) fill. Its top-right inner corner is titled “HgVT Block ×L” in bold 12 pt Arial. Six algorithm modules appear as vertical rounded rectangles (3 px radius, 2 pt darker border, 80% region height, aligned center), organized left→right and connected by solid colored arrows: 1. Vertex Self Attn.: leftmost, ~13% width, pale pink (#ffdee3) fill, deep red border, centered bold black title (two lines, 10 pt Arial). 2. Edge Agg. Attn.: right of #1, light lavender (#dfe3ff) fill, purple-blue border, similar styling. 3.

Vertex FFN: right of #4, same width as #1, pale orange (#ffdfb2) fill, burnt-orange border. 6. Adj. Mask: square below #1, same height as #3, pale mint (#dff8df) fill, green border.  Three additional modules, expanding the block’s complexity, are placed:  - Hyperedge Mixer: vertical rounded rectangle below Edge FFN and Edge Dist. Attn., light yellow (#fff9dd) fill, gold border, connected by green and dark-blue solid arrows to the adjacent modules. - Spatial Aggregator: horizontal rounded rectangle positioned above Vertex Self Attn. and Edge Agg. Attn., pastel copper (#ffd9b3) fill, brown border, linked to the first two modules via orange and red arrows. - Feature Fusion: vertical rounded rectangle to the far right of Vertex FFN, pale lavender (#ece6ff) fill, purple border, receives inputs from Vertex FFN and Hyperedge Mixer.  Solid arrow system (3 pt width, 6 px arrowhead, rounded ends):  - Orange arrows (X_adj^(V)) travel from orange squares, curve up to Vertex Self Attn., passing through Spatial Aggregator, then above modules to Vertex FFN and Feature Fusion.  - Red arrows (X^(V)) begin at red squares, lead into Vertex Self Attn., flow into Edge Agg. Attn., then Edge Dist. Attn., proceed to Vertex FFN and Feature Fusion.  - Dark-blue arrows (X^(E)) start at navy squares, connect to the base of Adj. Mask, continue right into Edge FFN, then up to Hyperedge Mixer, out to Edge Dist. Attn. and Feature Fusion.  - Light-blue arrows (X_adj^(E)) flow from teal squares via left side into Adj. Mask, down to Edge FFN, through Hyperedge Mixer, then forward to Edge Dist. Attn. and Feature Fusion.  - Green arrows (A) originate from lime-green squares, arc into Adj. Mask, then up into Edge Agg. Attn., Edge Dist. Attn., Hyperedge Mixer, and Feature Fusion. All arrows are labeled “Flow” in italic gray 8 pt Arial near the mid-sections where paths descend (two instances).  The Pooling column (8% width, same light-gray fill, 2 pt dark-gray outline) contains stacked rectangles (6 px vertical gaps):  - Top: pale rose (#ffd5d5) fill, red border, caption “Mean Image” (centered 9 pt black). - Middle: very light sky-blue (#d8ecff) fill, blue border, caption “Mean Edge” (centered). - Bottom: deeper sky-blue (#bfe1ff) fill, blue border, caption “Expert Edge”. - Fourth rectangle (added): pale yellow (#fffbe6) fill, gold border, caption “Fusion Output” (centered 9 pt black).  The Output Head column (rightmost, 6% width) features a tall, horizontal rounded rectangle (burnt-orange #ff9b4b, 2 pt darker-orange border, rotated 90°). Bold white text, 11 pt Arial, reads “Output Head”, rotated 90° clockwise. A black triangular arrowhead connects from the Pooling column’s right edge to this column. Additionally, a secondary burnt-orange arrow links Feature Fusion in the central block directly to the Output Head.  The legend box in the bottom-right corner (14% width, ~28% height) displays a bold black “Legend” (10 pt Arial, left-aligned), followed by seven rows, each containing a 28 px horizontal colored line sample (3 pt thick) and label (9 pt Arial): orange (X_adj^(V)), red (X^(V)), dark-blue (X^(E)), light-blue (X_adj^(E)), green (A), gold (Mixer), and purple (Fusion). All superscripts are styled as small caps, 4 px vertical spacing.  Typography strictly uses bold 10 pt Arial for module titles and 8–9 pt Arial for all labels. Arrows are solid, filled, rounded ends. Module borders are 20% darker than their fills. Corners: large boxes 4 px radius; small boxes 3 px. Vertical center alignment is uniform across all modules and input stacks precisely align with the HgVT block’s left edge for smooth arrow flow. Uniform 10 px internal padding is maintained in each rounded rectangle.  The image is vector-based, CMYK palette safe, suitable for high-resolution print and scalable across formats."

ti2i_image_caption_176="The image consists of a 1056 px wide by 768 px high white canvas, divided vertically into two equal halves by space of 20 px between, with each half outlined by a large black solid rounded rectangle with 4 px stroke and 8 px corner radius. There is a clear padding of approximately 40 px around both rectangles within the canvas.  At the top-center of the left rectangle, a bold black sans-serif caption on a white background reads “Traditional Alignment” in 32 pt font. In the top-center of the right rectangle, a similar caption reads “Doc Domain Alignment”. Both captions are horizontally aligned and positioned well within the top border with consistent spacing.  **Left half: Traditional Alignment**  From top to bottom, centered within its panel:  1. At y ≈ 70 px, a small black line-art light-bulb icon (~40 px tall) is placed, with a tiny green label “WHAT?” (7 pt, sans-serif) directly beneath the filament. Right next to the bulb, a light-green (#8BC984) rounded rectangle 220 × 70 px containing the bold, centered text “Query” (24 pt, sans-serif).  2. Below this, a vertical sequence begins:    - A vertical solid gray (#9CA4A7) arrow (65 px long, 3 px stroke, filled arrowhead) points downward from the center of the Query box to...    - A “Query Encoder” box (220 × 90 px), filled light-peach (#FAD4C6), outlined in black (3 px), corners rounded (8 px radius), with centered label in 24 pt.    - A short vertical orange (#F36C25) arrow (50 px, 3 px stroke, filled tip) leads downward to...  3. A horizontal embedding bar (230 × 35 px, with 8 px corner radius) comprising seven equal vertical stripes (from left to right: #FCDDD3, #F9C5B8, #F7AB9C, #F4967F, #F37C65, #EF6751, #EB5945). Directly above, a small label “Query Embedding” (24 pt, sans-serif, centered).  4. Below the bar, a downward gray arrow (50 px, 3 px stroke) leads to a magnifying-glass icon (~30 px diameter, black line-art, 3 px stroke) angled down-right. Under the icon, small gray text reads “Vector Search” (18 pt, sans-serif).  5. A curved gray arrow (3 px, filled arrowhead) emerges rightward then downward, leading to the returned document area in the bottom left.  6. Returned docs: In the lower left, two stacked document-sheet icons (each 60 × 70 px, black line-art, slight offset), both with small check-marks in the lower-right corner.  7. Parallel to the query flow on the right side of the left panel:    - At top-right inside the panel, a black line-art multi-page document icon (~100 × 100 px).    - Directly below, a vertical gray arrow (85 px) leads to a “Doc Encoder” box (220 × 90 px, light-blue #B5D5F9, black outline, 8 px radius, centered text).    - Below, another vertical gray arrow (70 px) leads to an “Indexed Database” depicted as a blue (#1D7AD6) cylinder icon (~50 px diameter) inside a rounded rectangle (240 × 100 px, aqua fill #D0EBFF, outlined 3 px black, 8 px radius). The cylinder displays three small dots (red, green, yellow) arranged vertically on its left side.    - A curved gray arrow (from the database, sweeps left then down) joins the returned document icons at bottom-left.  **Right half: Doc Domain Alignment**  Mirrors the left, centered and balanced vertically and horizontally:  1. At top, a black line-art light-bulb icon (~40 px), with green “WHAT?” label under the filament, is paired with a light-green rounded rectangle (220 × 70 px, #8BC984) labeled “Query” (24 pt), identical format to left.  2. Directly beneath “Query”, a small horizontal royal-blue (#2A64FF) rectangle (70 × 28 px, 8 px radius, white bold text “LLM” centered, 18 pt).  3. Below, a vertical gray arrow (35 px) leads to a black line-art icon of a single-page document with a pencil overlay (60 × 70 px); next to this, right-aligned text “Synthetic Doc” (24 pt).  4. From the synthetic-doc icon, a horizontal solid arrow (sky-blue #41A0FF, 3 px stroke, filled tip) extends right into the “Doc Encoder” box (identical to left panel, mirrored at the same height).  5. Below the synthetic-doc icon, a downward gray arrow (40 px) leads to a horizontal embedding bar (230 × 35 px, seven vertical stripes: #FCDDD3, #F9C5B8, #F7AB9C, #F4967F, #F37C65, #EF6751, #EB5945). A small label “Synthetic Doc Embedding” (24 pt, centered) above.  6. Below, a downward gray arrow (45 px) connects to a magnifying-glass icon (~30 px diameter, black line-art, 3 px stroke) with small gray text beneath, “Vector Search” (18 pt).  7. A curved gray arrow sweeps right then downward, ending at a pair of stacked document icons at bottom-right (each 60 × 70 px, slightly offset, check-marks lower-right).  8. Parallel actual-doc flow at right:    - At far top-right, a black line-art multi-page document icon (~100 × 100 px).    - Vertical gray arrow (85 px) leads into the same “Doc Encoder” box (receives the sky-blue arrow from synthetic doc).    - From “Doc Encoder”, a vertical gray arrow (70 px) points downward to an “Indexed Database” rounded rectangle (240 × 100 px, aqua fill #D0EBFF, black outline, cylinder #1D7AD6, three colored dots on left: red, green, yellow).    - A curved gray arrow (right then down) exits database, pointing to the returned document icons at bottom-right.  **Additional modules and elements for complexity:**  - Within both panels, midway down between the encoder and embedding bar, a small circular icon (30 px diameter, black outline, yellow fill, with a gear motif inside) is present, labeled “Normalization” (18 pt, black, right of the icon). This is connected by short horizontal arrows (gray, solid, 3 px) from the encoder box to the embedding bar. - In both “Indexed Database” rectangles, an additional small vertical column of three document icons (20 × 24 px, stacked, black line-art, left side) illustrates indexed entries, horizontally aligned with the cylinder. - At the base of both panels, below the returned-doc cluster, a small white rectangle (120 × 36 px, 3 px black outline, 8 px radius) contains three colored circle icons (red, blue, green, each 11 px diameter, horizontally arranged center) and the label “Results Classifier” in 18 pt, black, sans-serif under the icons. Each returned-docs arrow flows into this classifier box. - At the far left and far right edges of the canvas (within the white padding), thin black vertical rectangles (6 × 80 px, 8 px corner radius) are placed at mid-panel height, each containing three equally spaced small triangle icons (orange, green, blue, each 14 px tall, stacked). The left-side bar is labeled vertically “Inputs”; right-side bar is labeled vertically “Outputs” (11 pt, black, sans-serif). - The overall diagram maintains strict vertical and horizontal symmetry. Each element’s placement mirrors its counterpart, all labels, lines, icons, and boxes use flat colors, solid strokes, and considerate spacing for clarity. No gradients or dashed outlines are present. The illustration is precise, concise, and comprehensive, presenting layered scientific workflows for both alignment strategies with enhanced module detail and explicit data pipeline clarity."
ti2i_image_caption_177="A vertically oriented canvas with a pure white background features a highly organized, vector-style schematic. At the top center is bold black text, “(Interleaved) Text / Image / Video”, followed directly below by a dotted black horizontal line (each dot 3 pt diameter, 3 pt gap) spanning 90% of the page width.  Beneath the heading is an expanded illustration example row. On the left, a black, left-aligned caption reads “What’s written on this image?”, positioned flush with the left edge of the subsequent encoder bar. Rightward are three evenly-spaced 90 × 90 px square thumbnails with 20 px gaps: (1) a photo of a hand (bottom center) holding a small beige wooden sign, three black text rows “KNOWLEDGE / IS / POWER” centered on the sign, against a vivid blue sky with wispy clouds; (2) a stylized “video strip” showing a person in a white shirt raising both arms, head replaced by a fluffy white cumulus cloud, six stepped rightward copies create a staircase silhouette, sky-blue background; (3) a clear text box illustration with black sans-serif font overlaid on a translucent white rectangle with slightly rounded edges—text reads “Text example: The value of context in vision-language models.”  Directly below, spanning the three thumbnails, is a broad horizontal rounded rectangle (light-grey #E5E5E5, 620 × 45 px). Centered within is black text: “Text tokenizer, Visual Transformer, & 3D Causal VAE Encoder”.  Four 1.5 pt solid black vertical stems descend from this bar: - Far left stem drops 80 px to a 120 × 35 px light-grey (#E5E5E5) box labeled “Embedding Layer”. - Center-left stem drops to a 120 × 30 px light-grey box labeled “Noise Scheduler”, which continues down via a short line to a 130 × 40 px pastel pink (#F5CACA) box with “Semantic Layers”. - Center-right stem drops to a 130 × 36 px pastel yellow (#FFEFA9) box labeled “Temporal Embedding”. - Far right stem drops to a 120 × 35 px pastel light-blue (#CBE1F6) box labeled “Projector”.  From “Semantic Layers”, “Temporal Embedding”, and “Projector”, three black vertical lines descend 40 px and converge at the top edge of a large lavender rectangle (300 × 60 px, fill #C9CEF9), with centered black text: “Cross-Modal Fusion & Alignment”.  A solid black vertical line extends 60 px downward from the center of this rectangle to the top middle edge of a very large pastel-green rectangle (540 × 170 px, fill #D8EED2). Along the inside top edge of this rectangle are 16 evenly-spaced 22 × 22 px squares (fill #CBE9C2); along the bottom edge, a matching row of 16 squares. For each top-square/bottom-square pair, a faint curved grey arc (stroke #9BA29A, 50% opacity) connects them inside the green rectangle, with three horizontal pale-grey lines spanning the box's width between the arcs, representing additional attention pathways.  Centered in the pastel-green rectangle at mid-height, two lines of text: Top line is “Sh o w - o 2+” where S (blue #4D87F7), h (green #66B76A), o (yellow-orange #F4AF45), w (red #F1645C), -o2+ (black); all characters medium sans-serif font. Second line is black text in parentheses: “(Causal & Cross-Modal Full Attention, Hierarchical Blocks)”.  Three output stems extend from the large pastel-green rectangle’s bottom edge: - Left stem drops to a 120 × 35 px light-grey box labeled “LM Head”. - Center stem drops to a 120 × 35 px pastel violet (#DED1F6) box, labeled “Vision Head”. - Right stem drops to a 120 × 35 px pastel peach (#F9D7B8) box, labeled “Flow Head”.  From the bottom center of each of these three output boxes, solid vertical lines converge at a final wide light-grey rounded rectangle (540 × 45 px, fill #E5E5E5), labeled “Text De-Tokenizer, Vision Decoder & 3D Causal VAE Decoder” in centered black sans-serif font.  From the bottom center of this rectangle, a solid black arrow points straight downward, off the page, signifying continued downstream processing.  All columns and rows are horizontally and vertically aligned, with ample, consistent vertical spacing between modules. The muted pastel palette and precise, clean design evoke clarity and professional research-paper quality."

Far left: At the top, a 300 × 300 px square photograph of a cartoon penguin warrior with black body, orange beak and feet, metallic gray horned Viking helmet, a matching breastplate, and a flowing crimson cape. The background of the photo is warm beige. Centered directly beneath the photo: a gray (50% black) horizontal hairline (width equals the photo) and below it, in medium-gray (#6E6E6E), the label ‘Image’.  Below, a horizontal rounded rectangle (200 px × 54 px) filled with colorful static-noise dots, followed by three miniature identical copies inside a continuous outlined elongated rounded rectangle to imply a sequence. To the right, ‘Noisy Latent’ label in same medium gray.  Below that, left-aligned with the noisy latent row, the label ‘Timestep t’.  To the right, a large sky-blue (#E9F4FF) rounded rectangle, 1650 px wide × 400 px tall, outlined with a 4 px navy-blue dashed border (dash: 8 px). Top-center title in dark navy: ‘Hunyuan3D-DiT’. Internally, three input branches organized vertically and converging at a central processing area:  Top input branch (Image branch): leftmost, a tall peach-orange (#F7C4AD) vertical rounded rectangle labelled ‘DINO’, connected by a thin dark-gray right-pointing arrow to a light-blue (#CFE6FF) vertical rounded rectangle of equal height labelled ‘Linear’.  Immediately below (Noisy latent branch): a light-blue ‘Linear’ block, same size and style, directly receiving an arrow from the noisy latent sequence.  Bottom input branch (Timestep branch): a peach rectangle labelled ‘PE’ left-adjacent to a light-blue rectangle labelled ‘MLP’; both half the height of upper blocks. A thin right-pointing dark-gray arrow connects ‘Timestep t’ to ‘PE’, and extends to ‘MLP’.  All three branches converge via individual thin gray arrows toward the left side of a large vertical rounded rectangle labelled at its top-center as ‘DiT Block’ (fill light-grey #E5E5E5, 300 px wide × 290 px tall). Inside, four slim vertical sub-rectangles stacked and labelled ‘Transformer’; between the third and fourth a vertically-centered ‘⋯’ glyph and next to it small text ‘× 21’.  Right of the DiT Block, a thin dark-gray arrow extends to a vertical light-blue ‘LayerNorm’ rounded rectangle, then another right-pointing arrow goes to a vertical peach ‘Scale & Shift’ block. Under this, a small light-blue square labelled ‘Mod’ with an upward gray arrow connecting into ‘Scale & Shift’ as modulation input.  A thin right-pointing arrow continues from ‘Scale & Shift’ to a light-blue vertical ‘Linear’ rounded rectangle. From the right edge of this ‘Linear’ block, a column of four vertically-stacked light-blue rounded squares (each 34 × 34 px) appear, labelled on the right as ‘Shape Latent’. Below this column, the text ‘Shape Latent’ (medium gray).  Above and below the core sky-blue rectangle, at the top and bottom (beyond the main modules), two horizontal slim rectangles: top displays the label ‘Inputs’; bottom displays ‘Outputs’, both in navy font centered horizontally.  To the immediate right of the core network is a large orange-brown dashed rounded rectangle (410 px wide × 360 px tall, 4 px stroke, dash: 8 px) titled at top-center ‘VAE-Decoder’ (dark orange). Inside, at the left, the same vertical column of four light-blue squares is repeated (input). To the right, a tall vertical peach block labelled ‘Self Attention’ with black ‘×16’ vertically stacked at its midsection. A thin right arrow connects to another slim peach vertical rectangle labelled ‘Self Attention’; a further right-pointing arrow leads to a peach rectangle labelled ‘Cross Attention’. Between all attention blocks are thin gray right-pointing arrows.  At the bottom inside the VAE box, centered, a row of three equal squares (34 × 34 px each): left square light-blue, center peach, and right light-green (#CDE9D0), labelled just beneath as ‘Query points Q’ in gray.  Directly above ‘Query points Q’, a slim horizontal rounded rectangle (100 px × 34 px, white background, thin gray border) containing three color-coded tiny glyphs representing query types: image, shape, and noise.  From the right edge of ‘Cross Attention’, a thick black arrow labeled ‘MC’ heads into a green-dashed rounded rectangle (280 px wide × 360 px tall, 4 px, dash: 8 px). Inside, three grayscale clay-rendered 3D models of the penguin warrior are vertically arranged: top model is a front view (occupying ~60% of width), middle model is a ¾ perspective, and bottom is a left-side profile view. Each model has subtle ambient-occlusion shading. At the bottom-center inside the rectangle, a dark-green (#178533) caption: ‘3D Shape’.  To the right of the green dashed rectangle, a slim vertical column of three mini light-blue rounded rectangles, each linked to the 3D models by dotted gray connectors, and labelled ‘Shape Features’ in dark green at the right.  Elsewhere, between the ‘Noisy Latent’ module and ‘Linear’ block, as well as between each major block transition, thin clear gray arrows convey data flow—arrows are always solid; no gradients or dashed lines except for non-deterministic modulation arrows and box outlines where stated. Above the DiT Block, a slim dark-gray double-headed arrow labelled ‘Skip’ connects the input Linear to the output Linear.  All elements maintain consistent 40 px horizontal and 20 px vertical gutters. Every rectangular module, photo, and arrow is perfectly aligned and evenly spaced. All texts are sharply centered within their respective blocks, ensuring a balanced, professional scientific-paper style throughout."
ti2i_image_caption_179="The image is a horizontally oriented, 3-row scientific flowchart on a white background with a thin mid-grey outer margin and an overall aspect ratio of approximately 2.2:1. All text is in a black monospace font at 90 % opacity, with panel titles in bold. Modules and connectors feature solid colors without dashed lines or gradients, except for the framing boxes.   GLOBAL STRUCTURE  The canvas consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width separated by light-grey dividers, each enclosed by a light-grey dashed rectangle. Row-1 (top) covers 40 % of the height; Row-2 (middle) covers 35 %; Row-3 (bottom) covers 25 %. All rounded rectangles have a 6 px corner radius and subtle 4 px, 20 % opacity drop shadow.   ROW-1  (left two-thirds of canvas)  Top-left inside the dashed frame displays the bold header “datasets”.   Directly underneath, four small lavender rounded rectangles are spaced horizontally:  • far-left: “Rossetta” with a Python emoji 🐍 in the top-left    • left-middle: “Alpaca” with Python emoji    • right-middle: “ShareGPT” with Python emoji    • far-right: “OpenOrca” with Python emoji   Size for each: ≈ 110 × 34 px. Three vertical downward red arrows (#C42222) under the first three rectangles and a purple vertical arrow (#9053AA) under the far-right rectangle.  Below the arrows, centered, is an extended steel-blue horizontal rounded rectangle (≈ 570 × 46 px) labelled “tuning with foundation model & adapters”.  Below this, four more vertical arrows: three red (#C42222) under the first three rectangles and one purple (#9053AA) under the far-right.  A new sub-header “checkpoints” appears under the tuning bar.  Below the sub-header, horizontally align four sky-blue rounded rectangles:  • far-left: label “LLM_Rossetta”    • left-middle: label “LLM_Alpaca”    • right-middle: label “LLM_ShareGPT”    • far-right: label “LLM_OpenOrca”   Each ≈ 140 × 34 px. Between each rectangle appear three dark-grey ellipsis dots (“...”) for possible more boxes.  In the bottom-left corner of this dashed frame, a dark-grey italic caption reads “1. training data preparation”.   ROW-2  (right two-thirds horizontally, full stripe height)  Top-left inside the dashed frame: bold header “prompt-ckpt pairs”.  Beneath, a large grey dashed circle (#AAAAAA, 3 px stroke, diameter ≈ 260 px) contains eight miniature rounded rectangles (four lavender, four sky-blue), scattered in two offset rows of four to simulate paired records. A faint ellipsis of three dots is centered at the bottom of the circle.  From the right edge of the circle, three solid black arrows point outward: 1. Top arrow slopes up-right to a miniature lavender rectangle (≈ 70 × 26 px). From there, a right-pointing black arrow leads to a wheat-yellow rounded rectangle (≈ 150 × 46 px) labelled “❄ text encoder” (snowflake icon at left). Next, a right-pointing black arrow into a forest-green rounded rectangle (≈ 140 × 46 px) labelled “embedding”. From “embedding,” a downward green arrow (#228822) leads to the top of a large peach rounded rectangle (≈ 170 × 60 px) labelled “parameter generator”.  2. Middle arrow leads to a miniature sky-blue rectangle (≈ 70 × 26 px); a right-pointing blue arrow (#4455AA) leads into a dark-blue square (40 × 40 px) representing loss, labelled “loss” underneath. From the right of the square, a right-pointing arrow enters the left side of “parameter generator”.  3. Bottom arrow slopes down-right into a miniature tan rectangle (≈ 70 × 26 px) labelled “external”. A right-pointing olive-green arrow (#6EA345) leads from this rectangle to an additional olive-green rounded rectangle (≈ 140 × 46 px) labelled “❄ domain adapter” (snowflake icon left). From here, a downward black arrow flows into the peach “parameter generator”.  At the lower-right inside the frame, place a small horizontal stack of three tiny lavender rectangles labelled “aux”, “meta”, and “probe”, aligned just above the bottom edge.  Caption in bottom-left corner: “2. training of DnD”.   ROW-3  (full width, split into three vertical subsections)  At the bottom-center of the entire row is a caption: “3. evaluating DnD on novel datasets”, with the keyword “DnD” in bright-red.

ti2i_image_caption_180="A high-resolution, landscape-oriented scientific diagram (1700×600 px) is laid out from left to right in five distinct columns with clean, minimalist design elements. All boxes feature thin black stroke lines (1.5 pt), soft pastel background fills at 30% opacity, medium-weight Helvetica headings, regular sans-serif body text, 4 px corner radii, 2 px box padding, subtle drop shadows (2 px at 45°, 20% black), and solid black arrowheads. Black solid circles (24 px diameter) carry bold white numerals '1' through '6' to indicate numbered interaction steps.   Far-left column (width 310 px):   At the top, a large rounded rectangle labeled “Application Library (§3.3)” (300×210 px, pastel periwinkle #ccd9ff). Inside, a 2×2 grid of four rounded rectangles (120×70 px, white fill, thin outline), each labeled: Chatbot (top-left), Live Captions (top-right), Deep Research (bottom-left), Image Generation (bottom-right). To the right of these boxes, vertically centered, a small column of two icons: a YAML file icon (three stacked dog-eared sheets, white fill, black outline; “YAML” in uppercase blue monospace), and beneath it, a JSON file icon (three stacked dog-eared sheets, white outline, blue border; center label “JSON” in uppercase orange monospace). A short vertical gap (25 px) divides these icons. Right-pointing black arrow runs from the YAML icon to the next module, overlaid at the midpoint with circled ‘1’. From the JSON icon, an upward curving black arrow connects to the Chatbot box, overlaid with circled ‘2’.    Center-left column (width 220 px):   Rounded rectangle labeled “DAG Builder (§3.2)” (200×90 px, lilac fill #d8c8e9). A downward arrow links the “Application Library” box to the top edge of the DAG Builder; circled ‘3’ at its midpoint. From the right edge, black arrow runs to the next column, carrying circled ‘4’.
