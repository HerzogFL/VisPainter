The figure uses clear geometric shapes, arrows, dashed boundaries, and labeled text to convey information. Here's a detailed breakdown of the image specifications:  ---  ### **General Layout** - The illustration is divided into two distinct sections on a white background:   - **Left Block:** Represents a hierarchical stack of layers, with input and output flow illustrated using arrows, and mathematical operations depicted.   - **Right Block:** Represents a recursion mechanism, enclosed in a dashed boundary, showing interconnected recursive layers.  ---  ### **Left Block** #### **Overall Structure** - The block consists of a vertically stacked set of rectangular modules (layers), labeled from bottom to top. It illustrates data flow through layers, culminating in outputs. - Each module is contained within a larger rounded rectangular enclosure outlined with a **dark blue border line**.  #### **Component Breakdown** 1. **Bottom Input**    - At the base of the block, there is a small squared box containing the text **“𝑥ₜ”** (subscript notation for input).    - **Arrow Direction:** A single dark **blue upward arrow** emerges from this box to connect to the **Router**.  2. **Router Module**    - Above the input box, there's a horizontally rectangular box labeled **“Router”**. Its border is dark blue, and its fill color is a lightly shaded `pastel blue`.    - On its right, a vertical label reads **“g = 0.7”**. Font is black and placed parallel to the module’s edge.  3. **Layer Stack**    - Three separate rectangular modules represent layers:      - **Bottom Layer**: Labeled **“Layer 1”**, filled with a `pastel purple` color, and outlined with a dark **blue border**.      - **Middle Layer**: Labeled **“Layer 2”**, filled with a `pastel pink` color, and outlined with a dark **blue border**.      - **Top Layer**: Labeled **“Layer 𝐿−2”**, filled with a light **yellow color**, outlined with a dark **blue border**. Three vertical dots (`…`) indicate continued layers.    - Each layer stack shares the same width to ensure symmetry.  4. **Arithmetic Operations at the Output**    - The top of the block contains **two horizontal arrows** converging into a `circle symbol`.     - **Symbols:**       - The first circle contains a **plus symbol (+)** (addition operation).       - The second circle contains a **multiplication symbol (×)**. Each circle is outlined in **dark gray** with **white fill**.    - **Lines:** Thin black lines connect the output circles back toward earlier layers, representing feedback or skip connections.  ---  ### **Right Block** #### **Overall Structure** - The block is enclosed within a larger dashed rectangular boundary. The dashed **blue lines** outline this recursion block. - The recursion framework is designed to show multilayer connections and feedback loops.  #### **Component Breakdown** 1. **Recursive Layers**    - Rectangular boxes near the top labeled **“Layer 𝐿−1”**. These boxes alternate in colors: **pastel blue** and **pastel pink** in sequence. Each box is small and evenly sized.     - **Connections:** Each box emits a **thin vertical arrow** pointing downward to the main recursion block.  2. **Central Recursion Block**    - A large vertically elongated **gray rectangle** is at the center, labeled **“Recursion Block”** in bold black text.    - Each input (from the small boxes above) connects to this recursion block via **thin dark blue vertical arrows**.  3. **Base Layer**    - Below the recursion block is another rectangular module labeled **“Layer 0”**. Every arrow from the block points back toward this layer to signify iterative recursion.  4. **Circular Feedback Arrow**    - On the top right, a **curved arrow** emerges from the recursion block indicating a feedback mechanism. The arrow loops downward and terminates at the dashed boundary, adding symbolic representation of iterative processing.  ---  ### **Styling** - All text is black, sans-serif font, bold for labels within boxes, regular for annotations or labels outside. - Blue dashed lines (recursive section) and a mix of solid black and blue for arrows. - Geometric shapes aligned precisely, maintaining symmetry and clarity of data flow."

Estimated state      • Light mint-green rectangle (#C8F0C8), 100 × 46 px, 1 pt black stroke.      • Inside centred text: “ Estimated State ” on first line, “x̂ₖ” (x-hat sub k) on second line, both in 11-pt bold serif.      • A solid black arrow leaves its right edge.  4. Measurement model      • Light tan rectangle (#F2E4BB), 122 × 46 px, 1 pt black stroke.      • Inside top-centre put “h(·)” in 12-pt italic; below it centered put “Measurement Model” in 11-pt bold serif.      • Solid black arrow exits its right edge.  5. Predicted state output      • White rectangle, identical to earlier, placed just outside the violet rectangle’s right edge.      • Inside text: “Xₖ|ₖ₋₁” (capital X, sub k|k-1) in 12-pt italic.      • A thick black arrow (2 pt) leaves this block, runs upward parallel to the right border of both dashed rectangles, then bends 90° left at the upper band’s mid-height, re-entering the cyan box and finally connecting to the same horizontal line that carries “yₖ”. (Purpose: feed the next iteration.)      • Another long black arrow loops from this right-hand rectangle back to the very first “xₖ₋₁” block on the left edge of the figure, closing the outer recursion path.  STYLISTIC DETAILS   • Use consistent serif font (e.g., Times New Roman) for all mathematical variables; sans-serif (e.g., Arial) for explanatory text (“time delay”, “learning phase”, etc.).   • All variable letters (x, y, r, W) italic; subscripts k, k-1, k|k-1 set smaller (≈70 %).   • Arrow heads: filled black triangles, size 6 × 8 px.   • Ensure perfect alignment: all horizontal arrows are precisely level; vertical arrows perfectly plumb.   • Keep generous white margins around the whole diagram for publication clarity.  The resulting illustration must look identical in clarity, colour and geometry to a professional figure in a peer-reviewed journal."

COMMON ELEMENTS FOR BOTH PANELS 1. Top icon: centered at the top of each panel, an orange (#F47A24) human silhouette bust (simple flat icon, head + shoulders, no facial features, width ≈60 px, height ≈60 px). 2. Directly beneath each bust: a vertical black (#000000) arrow (stroke 3 px, arrowhead height=12 px) pointing downward, with the label “Task” in bold black Open-Sans, 20 pt, left-aligned to the arrow’s right side. 3. Around the next three or four blocks (depending on panel) draw a rectangular dashed outline: stroke color slightly darker orange than the bust (#E46D3C), stroke 3 px, dash length 12 px, gap 8 px, corner radius 12 px.

Inside, top-centered, a white silhouette drone icon (~50 px wide); beneath it, centered text “Drone Execution” in bold white, 24 pt. 8. Panel captions: underneath each blue block, center the caption. Left: “(a)” in gray (#555555), 22 pt. Right: “(b) GSCE” in the same gray, 22 pt. Captions are aligned so their baselines are equal.  LEFT PANEL SPECIFIC ( (a) ) Inside the dashed orange rectangle beneath the green LLM block place two grey modules stacked vertically:  • Module 1 (immediately under LLM): rounded rectangle, width 80 %, height 70 px, corner radius 10 px, fill light-gray (#D1D1D1). Centered text: “Guidelines” in black, 22 pt.  • Module 2 (under module 1): same style rectangle, same size; centered text: “Skill APIs” in black, 22 pt.  RIGHT PANEL SPECIFIC ( (b) GSCE ) Inside its dashed orange rectangle position four small grey modules in a 2 × 2 grid (two rows, two columns) directly beneath the green LLM block. The overall grid width equals 80 % of panel width; each module therefore uses 48 % width (with 4 % gutter). Each module: height 70 px, corner radius 10 px, fill light-gray (#D1D1D1). Text inside each module is two-line, centered, with the first word plain black 20 pt and the second bold black 20 pt:  Top-left: line1 “Guidelines”, line2 bold “Shape LLM”.  Top-right: line1 “Skill APIs”, line2 bold “Empower LLM”.  Bottom-left: line1 “Constraints”, line2 bold “Regulate LLM”.  Bottom-right: line1 “Examples”, line2 bold “Illustrate LLM”.  Spacing: 20 px vertical gap between LLM block and first row; 18 px between the two grid rows.  FONT & STYLE Use a modern, clean sans-serif font (Open-Sans or similar) throughout. All rectangles and arrows have flat colors, no gradients, no drop shadows. Maintain perfect alignment and consistent spacing so the diagram looks professional and publication-ready."
t2i_image_caption_67="The image-generation system:  “Please render a high–resolution, 2-D vector-style scientific diagram that illustrates the architecture of a LLaMA-based transformer with two external adapters and a learned routing gate.   Use a clean, flat design with thin, crisp strokes (≈1.25 pt) and professional academic colour palette.   Overall canvas ratio ≈5:4 (width × height), white background.  GLOBAL LAYOUT 1. The entire diagram is divided vertically into a LEFT main-model column (≈55 % width) and a RIGHT adapter / gating column (≈45 % width).   2. The LEFT column itself is split horizontally into a LOWER light-green panel (labelled “LLaMA transformer × N-L”) and an UPPER light-green panel (labelled “LLaMA transformer × L”).   3. On the extreme left, a single blue residual stream travels upward as a thick vertical arrow (stroke colour #00688B) passing through plus-in-circle symbols at each residual addition point.  DETAILED ELEMENTS FROM BOTTOM TO TOP, LEFT COLUMN  A. Instruction input   • Bottom-left outside of the lower panel, centred horizontally under the residual stream, place text “Instruction” in medium-gray (#565656), 9 pt, italic.   • A very thin upward arrow (gray) points from the word “Instruction” to the next block.  B. “Embedding” block   • Immediately above “Instruction”, draw a rounded rectangle 80 px × 26 px, fill solid black, 2 px corner radius.   • Inside, centre the word “Embedding” in bold white, 9 pt.  C. First residual addition (lower panel)   • Directly above the “Embedding” block, in the residual column, draw a dark-teal filled circle Ø 18 px with a white plus symbol inside (horizontal + vertical lines 9 px).   • The residual stream arrow continues out of the top of this circle.  D. Two repeated sub-blocks inside LOWER light-green panel   • Give the lower panel a very light green background (#E9F6E9) with subtle 1 px stroked border.   • In the top-left corner of this panel, light-gray text “LLaMA transformer × N-L” (8 pt, semi-transparent 45 %) is placed.  For each of the two sub-blocks (bottom one first):    1. Residual path: from the residual column’s circle, a horizontal arrow heads right (~45 px) into a white rectangle 80 × 24 px with 2 px orange border (#F78043) labelled “RMSNorm” (bold black, 8 pt).      2. From this rectangle, a right-angle arrow turns upward into a forest-green rectangle 100 × 32 px filled #79A97D labelled “LLaMA Attention” (white bold, 8 pt).      3. A narrow upward arrow (same blue) runs into a beige rectangle 100 × 32 px filled #E6CCB3 labelled “LLaMA MLP” (black bold, 8 pt).      4. From the right edge of “LLaMA MLP” a thin cyan arrow loops back leftward and downward (making a 90° bent residual path) to feed into the next residual plus-circle one level above.  E. Second residual addition in LOWER panel   • Identical teal plus-circle positioned one sub-block height above the previous one.  F. Exit of LOWER panel   • A vertical blue arrow leaves the topmost lower plus-circle and enters a stand-alone white “RMSNorm” rectangle (same styling) positioned in the white gap between lower and upper panels.  UPPER PANEL (LLaMA transformer × L)   • Same pale-green background (#E9F6E9) but slightly taller.   • Label in the top-left corner “LLaMA transformer × L” in 8 pt light-gray, 45 % opacity.   • Inside, replicate exactly ONE sub-block consisting of:    1. plus-circle (input from previous RMSNorm)      2. “RMSNorm” rectangle      3. green “LLaMA Attention” rectangle      4. beige “LLaMA MLP” rectangle   • From the right edge of the “LLaMA MLP”, instead of looping back, a horizontal blue arrow goes straight into the gating mechanism on the right column.  GATING / ADAPTER COLUMN (right side)  1. Two pastel-pink vertical adapter blocks aligned to the right edge, each 110 px wide × 100 px high with rounded 4 px corners, light-pink fill (#FCE5E5), thin 1 px border.    Adapter 1 (left of the pair), Adapter 2 (right).      Both have internal split:     a. Upper half: green rectangle (#8DBB8D) with white text “Self Attention”, centred, 8 pt.      b. A thin black multiplication symbol “×” centered below the first rectangle.      c. Lower half: light-gray rectangle (#DFDFDF) with black text “Gating Factor”, centred, 8 pt.  2. The horizontal blue arrow from “LLaMA MLP” enters the left edge of a dark-cyan circle Ø 18 px containing a white tilde “~” (ASCII approximation symbol) signifying the gating decision.  3. Two additional thin cyan arrows come from the right-hand edges of both adapter blocks and converge into the same tilde-circle, indicating parallel inputs.  4. From the bottom of the tilde-circle, a vertical cyan arrow descends into a tall baby-blue rectangle (width ≈ 120 px, height ≈ 105 px) labelled “MLP” in black bold 9 pt centred at top.     Inside this light-blue block, stack three darker-blue (#005F9E) horizontal bars, each 95 × 22 px, aligned centre with 4 px vertical spacing.  White text centered in each bar:         • top bar: “Linear:512→1”         • middle bar: “Linear:1024→512”         • bottom bar: “Linear:dim→1024”  MISCELLANEOUS • Use consistent arrowheads: filled equilateral triangles, 7 px side, colour matches arrow stroke.   • All fonts are a modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter or Arial).   • Ensure adequate 14 px gaps between parallel arrows to avoid clutter.   • No drop-shadows; keep everything flat.  The final figure should read cleanly at 300 dpi on an A4 page, with every label legible and colour-blind-friendly contrast.”"

I. Downward arrow and final model score    • From the midpoint under the green dashed frame draw a thick black downward arrow (80 px long, 2.5 px stroke, filled arrowhead).      • Directly to the right of the arrow shaft, in italic, 22 pt, place “Eq. 5”.      • At the arrow tip, render a lavender rounded rectangle (corner radius 12 px, 260 px × 66 px, fill #DCC9F0, outline #9C83C2 1.5 px) with centred text:          S^{model} = 1.90   Important micro-details • All arrows, dotted lines, dashed outlines use pure black (#000) strokes except where colour is explicitly given.   • All boxes cast no shadow.   • Mathematical variables keep italic style even inside normal sentences.   • Ensure subscripts are baseline-shifted downward and 0.65× main font size.   • Text inside coloured rectangles is perfectly vertically and horizontally centred.   • Maintain plenty of white space around every element so that nothing feels crowded, exactly as in a polished research paper figure.  The resulting graphic should look indistinguishable from a high-resolution vector figure published in an ACL/ICML-style paper."

Main transformer block (centre):    • Enclosed by a tall light-grey (#e5e5e5) rounded rectangle (corner radius 18 px) that starts ~10 px below the legend and finishes well above the bottom caption, width ≈60 % of canvas.    • Inside, four horizontal modules stacked with equal vertical spacing (12 px):      a) Topmost: pale-yellow (#fff2c6) rectangle labelled “ADD & Norm”, width 85 % of the container, height 50 px. Place a small 🔥 emoji at the extreme left inside the module, text centred.        b) Second: sky-blue (#b7d4f7) rectangle labelled “FFN”, same width & height, 🔥 emoji on left.        c) Third: pale-yellow rectangle identical to (a) labelled “ADD & Norm”, 🔥 emoji on left.        d) Fourth (bottom inside block): pale-yellow rectangle labelled “Self-Attention”, 🔥 emoji on left.       • Vertical solid black arrow (2 px) runs straight down the centre of the stack, entering the top ADD & Norm from above and exiting the Self-Attention at bottom.      • Thin black residual arrows (2 px) form left-side skip connections: each originates at the left edge of a module, goes straight left 14 px, down to the level of the next lower module, then right into its left edge. The arrowheads point right. All of these are solid black (activated forward).    3. Input modules (bottom, beneath the grey container by 16 px):    • Left branch – Text path:      – A light-green (#d4e9c3) rectangle labelled “Word Embedding”, small 🔥 at left. Size ≈80 × 40 px.        – A solid black vertical arrow drops 14 px from its top centre into the bottom edge of Self-Attention.        – Under this rectangle, centre the word “Text” in plain black italics, no border.       • Right branch – Image path:      – At the same vertical level as “Word Embedding”, another light-green rectangle labelled “MLP”, 🔥 on left, same size.        – Directly beneath “MLP”, a smaller light-grey rectangle (60 × 34 px) labelled “Vision Encoder” with a ❄️ emoji centred to the left of the text.        – A solid black vertical arrow links Vision Encoder → MLP, and another arrow continues upward from the centre top of MLP into the bottom of Self-Attention (aligned horizontally with the Text branch arrow).        – Under Vision Encoder, centre the word “Image” in plain black italics.       • A thin horizontal brace line (straight 2 px) connects the tops of the two light-green rectangles, with tiny downward-pointing 45° chevrons at both ends, visually grouping them.    4. Caption (bottom):    • Bold black centred text: “(a) Stage I: ” on first line, second line “Warm-up”. Use 12 pt font, no border, positioned ~20 px below the lowest element.  5. Colour key:    • 🔥 icons denote modules in TRAIN mode (coloured modules).      • ❄️ icon denotes frozen module.      • Black solid arrows = activated forward, black dashed arrows (present only in legend) = non-activated forward, red dashed arrow (present only in legend) = evolution signal.  Ensure perfect alignment, equal spacing, crisp vector rendering, and exact colour codes: pale-yellow #fff2c6, sky-blue #b7d4f7, light-green #d4e9c3, container-grey #e5e5e5, pure-black #000000, red #ff3b3b.”"
t2i_image_caption_77="A scientific-style schematic (vector graphic, 16:9 aspect, 300 dpi)    1. Global layout      • Create a single rectangular canvas with a thin #4A7EBB border, rounded corners (8 px radius), very light mint-green background (#EEF7EB).      • Divide the canvas horizontally into two equal “compartments”. Draw a horizontal #4A7EBB line (same stroke width as the border) at exact mid-height. The top compartment is “Adapter & FFN”; the bottom compartment is “Multi-head attention with LoRA”.    2. Compartment titles      • Top-left corner of the upper compartment: black, small-caps text “Adapter & FFN” (font: Times New Roman Bold-Italic, 18 pt).      • Top-left corner of the lower compartment, just under the horizontal divider: black, small-caps text “Mutli-head attention with LoRA” (note the deliberate misspelling that matches the original) in the same font/size.    3. Upper compartment content      • Place two large horizontal light-blue rectangles (#B6CFF5, 220 px × 55 px, 6 px corner radius) side-by-side, centred vertically. The left rectangle’s left edge is 70 px from the canvas border; the right rectangle is mirrored with 70 px margin on the right. 100 px of white space separates them.      • Inside each rectangle, centre the navy-blue text “Feed-forward” (Times New Roman Bold 20 pt).      • Inside the right-hand side of each rectangle place a small snowflake icon (hexagonal, 6 branches, filled #97C7F7, 22 px × 22 px) touching the right inner edge.      • Under the left rectangle, flush left, add a 28 px flame icon (red-to-orange gradient, #FF6B3B base, yellow core).      • Above each light-blue rectangle, draw an hour-glass-shaped adapter module: two isosceles trapezoids joined tip-to-tip (overall height 60 px, width 110 px).           – LEFT adapter filled with solid peach (#F2A56B) and a 2 px navy outline.           – RIGHT adapter only a 2 px navy outline, no fill (white interior).      • Draw an upward blue arrow (2 px stroke, arrow-head) from the top centre of each “Feed-forward” rectangle to the centre of its hourglass.      • From the top centre of each hourglass draw a short vertical line (15 px) upward to a ⊕ residual-connection symbol: a 30 px perfect circle with a 2 px navy outline and a black plussed cross (+) inside.      • Between the two hourglass modules, exactly centred, place a bidirectional recycle/refresh icon: two curved arrows forming a circle, 60 px diameter, #4A7EBB stroke 3 px, arrowheads both clockwise.      • Beneath the two “Feed-forward” rectangles, in the middle gap, put three small vertically aligned black ellipsis dots indicating repetition.    4. Lower compartment content      • Place two self-attention blocks mirroring the layout above.           – Two light-blue rectangles (#B6CFF5, 220 px × 55 px) horizontally aligned, same horizontal positions as the feed-forward ones.           – Inside each, centre the navy text “Self-attention” (Times New Roman Bold 20 pt).           – On the right edge inside each rectangle, place a snowflake icon identical to above.      • Immediately under each self-attention rectangle, arrange three small square nodes (55 px × 55 px, 4 px radius, #C8D9F7 fill, #4A7EBB 2 px outline) labelled “q”, “v”, “k” in black Times New Roman Bold 26 pt. Position them horizontally with 8 px gaps, centred exactly under the parent rectangle.      • Between the q-v and v-k squares of each trio, insert thin hour-glass LoRA adapters identical in shape to the hourglasses above but at half scale (height 30 px, width 55 px):           – LEFT group adapters filled peach (#F2A56B) with flame icons (18 px) directly underneath the q and k squares.           – RIGHT group adapters outline-only (2 px navy) with no fill and a snowflake (18 px) below the v square.      • Draw navy arrows (2 px) connecting: q→k, k→v, v→q in a U-shaped fashion under each trio, replicating the original dashed routing (use a 4-pt dash pattern).      • From the centre top of each trio, draw a vertical arrow up into the bottom centre of its corresponding “Self-attention” rectangle.      • Between the two self-attention rectangles, centred, place a recycle symbol identical to the one in the upper compartment.      • Add a central faint dotted vertical guide line (#4A7EBB, 2 px, 30 % opacity) that passes through both recycle icons and between the two compartments for visual alignment (matches the original faint central axis).    5. Stylistic notes      • All blue lines/arrows/borders use hex code #4A7EBB and 2 px stroke except where specified thicker/thinner.      • Fonts: Times New Roman family for academic look; use Bold for labels, Bold-Italic for compartment titles.      • Keep equal horizontal and vertical margins (70 px) inside the main border to mimic balanced scientific diagrams.      • Ensure icons (flame, snowflake, recycle) have consistent style: flat minimal vector, no drop shadows, no gradients except the flame.      • Background is flat mint-green; light-blue blocks and peach adapters give clear color coding for frozen vs. trainable parameters.    The result should look like a clean, publication-quality transformer-block schematic with clear color-coded cues for trainable (flame, peach fill) vs. frozen (snowflake, outline-only) parameters, faithful to the layout, labeling, and symbols described above."
t2i_image_caption_78="A scientific-quality illustration (exact recreation)  Overall canvas   • Aspect ratio ≈ 3 : 1, 1588 × 556 px.   • White background, surrounded by a thin solid light-blue (#70A4DA) outer frame with 8 px corner radius.   • Inside the outer frame, everything is contained in one large rounded-corner rectangle outlined with a 2 px black dashed line (10 px dash, 6 px gap).

Upper aggregation branch   • Rightward arrow into purple module “Spatial Aggregation” (lavender fill, 255 × 90 px).   • Downward arrow into pale-pink “Conv, 1×1” box (225 × 80 px) directly below.   • Downward arrow again into an identical second “Conv, 1×1” box (stack space 40 px).   • Downward arrow continues 60 px then bends leftward 90° into a cyan plus-circle (same style). This circle sits 120 px from Block-B’s right border, 540 px from top.  Lower aggregation branch (mirrored)   • From the Block-A entry arrow, a duplicate arrow travels down hugging the inside left border of Block-B until it reaches a lilac tensor icon (190 × 90 px) labelled “H×C×T×W”. Icon interior shows 9 horizontal gradient bars (top light peach to bottom deep orange).   • Right arrow into the second purple “Spatial Aggregation” box (identical style) directly to its right.   • Upward arrow from this box connects to the lower “Conv, 1×1” box (already defined).    Merge and gating   • Output of the lower “Conv, 1×1” flows into the cyan plus-circle named earlier.   • That plus-circle’s rightward arrow goes into a cyan multiply-circle sitting 70 px to its right.   • Above that multiply-circle, a shortcut arrow drops vertically from the Block-B top-right corner (residual connection) into the same multiply-circle.   • Multiply-circle’s rightward arrow feeds a vertical, steel-blue (#a4b9ff) rounded rectangle (95 × 345 px) labelled “Depth-wise Conv Block”, centred horizontally 40 px inside Block-B’s right border.   • An arrow exits the bottom of this Depth-wise block and travels down and then left, hugging the Block-B border, to finally climb up and close the outer-level residual loop that re-enters the plus-circle located on Block-B’s upper-right perimeter (this loop is already partly drawn by the earlier shortcut arrow).  Typography   • Module labels: 24 pt bold Times New Roman, black, centred.   • Dimension annotations: 20 pt italic, black.   • Operator glyphs “+” and “×” inside circles: 26 pt bold.   • “Similarity calculation”, “Spatial Aggregation” and “Depth-wise Conv Block” use leading capitals, two-word titles on two lines if they overflow.  Colour palette summary   – lavender #baa7ff (Conv modules, Spatial Aggregation)   – sky-blue #a8c9ff (Similarity calculation)   – salmon-pink #f6c7c7 (1×1 Convs)   – beige #efccae (top tensor)   – lilac #d0b7ff (bottom tensor)   – turquoise #9ef0f0 (value tensor)   – tan #efccae (query tensor)   – green gradient (#acd9ac → #4f944f) (attention map tensor)   – cyan operator circles #d8f0ff   – steel-blue #a4b9ff (Depth-wise block)   – background #f7e6f4  Style   • Clean flat-design, no drop-shadows or gradients except inside tensor icons.   • All strokes 3 px, uniformly black.   • Consistent 40 px spacing between stacked modules/tensors unless otherwise stated."

Overall layout      • Center-left is a perspective “funnel” of four grey encoder blocks; center is a thin grey “Neck” block; center-right is a large transformer block; beneath the transformer block is a yellow dashed, double-headed arrow labelled “Anomaly Map”; bottom of the canvas contains a two-row bar (“Global” over “Single-Scale”) with a small green heat-map grid sitting on the right half of the bar.      • Title text “(b) UniAD” in bold, dark-grey (#4a4a4a) is placed flush-right above the encoder funnel, near the top-centre of the canvas.      • All arrows are solid black except the yellow dashed one. Use a clean sans-serif font (e.g., Helvetica or Arial) for every text element.    2. Encoder funnel (left side)      • Draw a left-leaning trapezoid outline (3 pt black stroke) whose left edge is vertical, whose right edge tilts slightly rightwards, whose bottom edge slopes up from left to right ∼10 °.      • Inside the trapezoid, place four vertically-oriented rounded rectangles (“Encoder 1”, “Encoder 2”, “Encoder 3”, “Encoder 4”).           – All encoders have identical light-grey fill (#d9d9d9), 2 pt black stroke, and a 6 px corner radius.           – Each encoder is slightly shorter and placed slightly further right than the previous, creating a receding perspective (stacked stair-step fashion).           – Black horizontal lines (2 pt) emerge from the top-right corner of every encoder, extending rightward past the trapezoid.    3. Neck block (middle)      • At the termination of those four horizontal lines, draw a single vertical rounded rectangle labelled “Neck”.           – Same light-grey fill and stroke as encoders, 6 px corner radius, height ≈60 % of an encoder’s height, width 40 % of its height.           – A bold, right-pointing black arrow (line weight 3 pt) exits the right edge of “Neck” into the transformer block.    4.

Anomaly Map arrow & label      • Under the transformer block, draw a dashed double-headed horizontal arrow, stroke color yellow-orange (#f2c94c), dash length ~12 px, arrow-head size equal at both ends.      • Centered above the dashed arrow is the text “Anomaly Map” in bold black, set inside a transparent rounded rectangle placeholder with 2 pt orange-brown stroke (#c98b2e) and 6 px corner radius. The rounded rectangle’s fill is white (so the text sits on white).    6. Heat-map grid and two-row bar (bottom)      • Across the full width, place a two-row horizontal band (height ≈60 px total).           – Upper row: light-grey band (#eeeeee) with the centred word “Global” (dark grey).           – Lower row: slightly darker grey band (#e0e0e0) labelled “Single-Scale”.      • On the right half of the bar, overlay a 7 × 7 square grid (thin #cccccc lines).           – Central cells of the grid are filled with varying green hues, forming a gaussian-like blob (center cell #3fa44a, neighbours lighter #7bc47f, outer cells almost white), the remainder stay white.           – The grid sits behind the text so that labels “Global / Single-Scale” remain fully readable.    7. Styling notes      • All labels use 24 pt font; main title “(b) UniAD” is 30 pt bold; foot-notes (“Global”, “Single-Scale”) 22 pt.      • Arrow heads use 60 ° angle, filled.      • Keep all elements aligned and evenly spaced; ensure high-contrast, print-ready colours; export as vector (SVG or PDF)."

Overall color palette: warm yellow (#FFE9A0), light peach (#FFD8A8), soft salmon-pink (#F7B7B5), pale orange (#FFC77E), dull beige-grey (#F7F7F7) background, and black text in a friendly geometric-sans typeface (similar to Google Product Sans). Use small flame emojis (🔥) in three places to indicate “learnable/trained” components.  GLOBAL LAYOUT 1. Everything sits inside a large rounded-rectangle panel (stroke: 3 px black, corner radius: 35 px, fill: #F7F7F7).  2. The panel has a 6-px thick outer drop-shadow to the lower-right (15 % opacity, #000).  TITLE BANNER • A horizontal banner overlaps the top frame, centered.  • Banner size ≈ 90 % width of the panel, height 11 % of panel height, fill color warm yellow (#FFE9A0), 3 px black outline.  • Centered inside, bold black text: “Masked Vector-Quantized Tokenizer”.  LEFT COLUMN (vertical dataflow, dashed border) • Draw a vertical, thin, dashed black line (stroke 2 px) splitting panel into 30 % left area vs. 70 % right. • On the left, arrange four blocks, top→bottom, connected by vertical dashed arrows (stroke 2 px, arrowheads 6 px).   A. “Masking Operation” block:      – Outline a rounded rectangle (115 % width of items below, fill pale orange #FFC77E).      – Inside, centered label: “Masking Operation” in 80 % font size.      – Immediately above the label, show TWO identical rows of four small squares (M tokens):        • Each square: 30 × 30 px, fill peach (#FFD8A8), 2 px outline.        • Each contains bold black letter “M”.        • The two rows are stacked with 10 px gap, enclosed by a dashed thin border to imply a unit.   B. “Item Representation” block:      – Same style rectangle but slightly wider, positioned 90 px below the masking block.      – Fill pale orange (#FFC77E). Text: “Item Representation”.   C. “Reconstruction” block:      – Same size/style as B, placed 110 px below.      – Text: “Reconstruction”.

Small black parent-edge lines connect them upward into a single root node (simulate a tree).     • To the right of the triangles, place a horizontal row of 5 yellow (#FFE9A0) rounded rectangles (140 × 55 px each, 25 px gap) representing encoded embeddings.         ◦ Each rectangle has a 2 px outline; no internal text.     • Under right edge of this encoder area, add a tiny flame emoji (🔥) to show it’s trainable.  (2) Center: “K-way Codebook”     • Bounding dotted box directly beneath encoder box (same width, 34 % height).     • Inside, depict K(vertical) × L(horizontal) codebook cells:         ◦ Choose K = 3 visible columns. Each column has 6 salmon-pink (#F7B7B5) rectangles (85 × 40 px, 18 px vertical gap).         ◦ Columns separated by 40 px.         ◦ Column headers (above rectangles) are small black numbers “1”, “2”, “K”.         ◦ Add a right-hand side tall brace with text “L” to indicate length.     • Flame emoji (🔥) at top-right corner of this dotted box.  (3) Bottom-right: “K-to-1 Decoder”     • Bounding dotted box (same width, 23 % height) under the codebook.     • Inside, draw one row of five salmon-pink rectangles identical to embeddings, connected downward into a single wide triangular funnel (like a ∨ shape) labeled “Dec”.         ◦ The funnel triangle: base 300 px, height 60 px, pointing down.     • Flame emoji (🔥) on the upper-right of the decoder box.  TOKENS BELT (rightmost vertical column) • To the extreme right (10 % width slice), draw a tall rounded rectangle (width 110 px, height 470 px, fill salmon-pink #F7B7B5, outline 3 px black). • Title inside top, small bold text: “Tokens”. • Inside, stack four smaller lighter-pink capsules (90 × 55 px, 25 px gap) each labeled “1”, “2”, “…”, “K” respectively.  CONNECTION ARROWS • From each yellow encoder embedding rectangle, draw a downward dashed arrow into the corresponding column of the codebook. • From each codebook cell row (dotted arrows) feed into the row of decoder embeddings. • From row of decoder embeddings, a dashed arrow enters the funnel “Dec”. • From “Dec” output, draw a right-facing solid arrow (stroke 3 px) merging into a black ⊗ (circle with a cross) symbol. • Similar ⊗ symbol sits at the meeting of Quantization:     – From the encoder’s embedding row, a right-facing solid arrow enters the ⊗ symbol labeled “Quantization”.     – The ⊗ then sends a downward dashed arrow to the Tokens belt, entering mid-height.  • On the far left dashed pipeline, connect “Item Representation” up to “Masking Operation” (solid arrow), up further (solid arrow) into left edge of encoder’s triangle tree.  TEXT ANNOTATIONS • Small italic labels:    – Next to the encoder arrow into ⊗: “Quantization”.    – Next to the downward arrow from decoder to left column: “Reconstruction”.  MISC • Use consistent 88 % opacity black for outlines; 70 % opacity black for dashed guide arrows. • All arrows use triangular arrowheads (8 px length). • Keep ample white space between modules for readability.”  "

Sized roughly 60 × 60 px.   • “Guided Template” icon: stylized newspaper or document page with three small rectangles (cyan, orange, and yellow) in its upper half, black outline, 48 × 60 px.   • “Reward” icon: clipboard with a small checkmark on top, 48 × 60 px.  Left half (Step-level reward):  1. Quality Reward row (top):    • Left: a single horizontal rounded rectangle (80 × 36 px) filled with salmon, no border.      • Right of that rectangle, an arrow pointing rightward toward the “Expert LLM” icon, with the italic label “Judge” placed above the arrow center. Distance between the rectangle and icon ≈ 80 px.  2. Coherence Reward row (middle):    • Three salmon rounded rectangles (size identical to above) labeled “Step 1”, “Step 2”, “Step 3”. They form a left-to-right chain with equal 16 px gaps.      • From the bottom edge between each successive pair, two black dashed V-shaped arrows merge downward into a single point, indicating branching.  3. Alignment Reward row (bottom):    • Two horizontal layers.        – Upper layer: three salmon rectangles, labeled “Step 1”, “Step 2”, “Step 3”, equally spaced.        – Lower layer: directly under each upper rectangle, a brick-red rectangle of identical size, also labeled “Step 1”, “Step 2”, “Step 3”.      • Between each vertically aligned pair (salmon on top, red beneath) is a short bidirectional black arrow (double-headed), signifying alignment comparison.      • Between successive columns of salmon rectangles are standard right-pointing arrows (black) showing forward progression.  Right half (Trajectory-level reward):  Top-left corner: • A light-gray rounded rectangle (120 × 34 px) labeled “Question”.  Directly under it (stacked): • A long salmon rounded rectangle (220 × 34 px) labeled “Thinking Trajectories”.   • A long brick-red rounded rectangle (220 × 34 px) labeled “Final Model Response”.   • Equal 10 px vertical spacing among the three.  Rightward flow: • A thick, straight black arrow runs right from the stack toward the “Expert LLM” icon. Above it in italic is the word “Verify”.   • From the Expert LLM icon, a continuation of the same arrow proceeds horizontally to the “Guided Template” icon, stopping flush against its left edge. The italic label “Guided Template” appears to the right of the arrow head, vertically centered with the document icon.  Downward flow: • From the bottom center of the “Guided Template” icon, a thick black arrow bends downward then left into a right-angled elbow, ending at the base label “θ”.   • Above the horizontal section of this bent arrow sits the italic word “Instruct”.  Policy model & response generation: • Just below the elbow arrow’s end point, place the label “Policy Model” in black text, center-aligned.   • To the left of “Policy Model”, three horizontal pastel-colored capsule “response sticks” (red “1”, yellow “2”, blue “3”), each with a tiny white number on its left tip. They are stacked vertically, 10 px apart.   • An arrow labeled “Generate” (italic, above arrow) points left-to-right from the response sticks to the “Policy Model” label.   • Another arrow points leftward from the response sticks into the “Reward” clipboard icon. That arrow is labeled “Reward” directly beneath it.  Bottom captions: • Across the entire dashed frame, centered at the bottom border, place the plus symbol “+” in bold 24 pt, separating the phrases “Step-level reward” (left half) and “Trajectory-level reward” (right half). Both phrases use italic 18 pt black font.  Background: • Pure white canvas ensuring crisp contrast with elements.   • All elements aligned precisely; equal margins (~40 px) inside the dashed rectangle on all sides.  Render everything in a flat minimalistic infographic style, consistent stroke widths, smooth rounded corners, and no shadows or gradients."

t2i_image_caption_111="A high–resolution, publication–quality, vector-style figure:  “Create a clean, minimalistic, vector flow-diagram (16∶9 aspect, white background, 300 ppi) that explains an LLM-driven trading-agent architecture.  Use a thin, uniform, black stroke (≈2 pt) for all shapes and arrows, except where explicitly stated.  All rectangles must have 8-px corner-radius and a subtle drop shadow (10 % black, ­45° offset, 3 px blur).

GLOBAL LAYOUT   • Overall canvas ≈ 1180 × 770 px.   • A large, black, dashed, rounded rectangle (dash length 14 px, gap 6 px, 2-pt stroke) occupies the central 80 % of the canvas; it encloses every module except the two data-source icons on the left.   • Inside this dashed frame, arrange the four main coloured blocks in a clockwise loop:     – top-left: “Prediction Agent Inputs” (dust-pink  ❬RGB ≈ 240-200-200❭)     – mid-right: “Prediction Agent” (soft sky-blue  ❬RGB ≈ 190-220-250❭)     – bottom-right: “Reward Agent” (pastel mint-green  ❬RGB ≈ 190-225-190❭)     – bottom-left: “Reflection Agent” (light amber-gold  ❬RGB ≈ 240-210-160❭)  DETAILED SHAPES & CONTENT  1) External data sources (far left, centred vertically)      a) Top source rectangle  (150 × 180 px, light grey #E5E5E5)         – Contains a stylised black-outlined newspaper icon (occupies top 65 %) with blue horizontal lines that mimic text.         – Under icon place the bold label “News”.         – To the right, align a horizontal solid arrow (60 px length) pointing toward the dashed frame; above this arrow, left-aligned, place the caption “LLM Summarizer Agent”.     b) 70 px vertical gap, then second source rectangle (150 × 180 px, same style)         – Inside, a mini candlestick chart: faint grey grid, green & red candles, small purple RSI line at bottom.         – Under the chart, label “Candlestick Chart”.         – To its right, another horizontal arrow (same style) labelled “LLM Analyst Agent”.  2) Prediction Agent Inputs block (dust-pink, 320 × 400 px)      – Title, centred at bottom edge inside the block: “Prediction Agent Inputs” in bold 14-pt.      – Inside, five stacked white pill-shapes, equal width (260 × 45 px) with 4-px radius and thin border; 18 px vertical spacing.  From top to bottom:           1. “Current Portfolio Metrics”           2. “News Summaries”           3. “Technical Chart Analysis”           4. “Reflections (Short-term and Medium-term)”           5. “Reflections (Previous Trading Signals)”      – The two incoming arrows from the external data sources terminate flush with the left edge of the second and third pills, respectively.      – A third solid arrow comes upward from the Reflection Agent (detailed later) and terminates at the fourth pill.      – Another thin solid arrow starts at the centre-right of this pink block and heads straight to the Prediction Agent block.  3) Prediction Agent block (sky-blue, 240 × 180 px)      – Title at top centre: “Prediction Agent” (bold).      – Inside, three left-justified code-style lines, 12-pt monospace, mid-grey text:          “Action: [BUY|SELL|HOLD]”          “Position Size: [1-10]”          “Reasoning: [Detailed rational …]”      – A downward solid arrow exits from its bottom-centre to the Reward Agent.      – From its top-edge centre, a solid arrow goes upward 60 px, bends right, then up-left along the inside of the dashed border, labelled on the top horizontal segment “Update for the next iteration”, finally looping back into the pink block’s top-edge centre (depicting feedback).  4) Reward Agent block (mint-green, 240 × 110 px)      – Title: “Reward Agent” (bold).      – White pill inside (180 × 40 px) labelled “Trade Execution Tool”.      – A leftward solid arrow exits from its left-centre, targeting the centre-right of the Reflection Agent block.  5) Reflection Agent block (amber-gold, 320 × 180 px)      – Title top-centred: “Reflection Agent”.      – Two stacked white pills (260 × 45 px each, 20 px gap):           a) “Trading Signals Chart”           b) “Short-term and Medium-term”      – A solid arrow rises from its top-left corner, bending slightly to reach the left edge of the pink block (landing on the 4th pill, see above).  ARROW STYLES   • All arrows solid black, 2 pt, standard triangular arrowhead.   • Arrows follow orthogonal or smooth right-angle bends to avoid overlap and keep the diagram tidy.   • No arrow overlaps text; ensure 10 px clearance between any arrow and label.  MARGINS & SPACING   • Maintain ≥ 40 px margin between the dashed frame and any inner coloured block.   • Keep identical horizontal distances (≈ 80 px) between neighbouring blocks to emphasise symmetry.   • Consistent 20 px padding inside every coloured rectangle.  OVERALL AESTHETIC   • Academic, publication-ready; background pure white; high contrast; minimal colour palette restricted to the four pastel fills plus grey source boxes.   • Everything centre-aligned horizontally on the canvas, with the two grey source boxes left-flushed for clear separation.   • Vector artwork (SVG or PDF) so it scales crisply.”  End of prompt."

Subfigure labels      • Place “(a)” in bold 28 pt at bottom-left inside the top dashed rectangle, touching its border.      • “(b)” and “(c)” placed directly left of their respective inset rectangles, aligned to top-left corners.    5. Subfigure (b) – “Tx DSP” internal flow      • Draw a thin solid black rectangle (no dashes) encompassing this inset.      • Title “Tx DSP” centered at top edge of the rectangle.      • Inside, create two horizontal rows:        Upper row (main payload path):          PRBS → Mapping          – Two pastel-pink rounded rectangles (w 180 px, h 75 px) with 30 px spacing.          – Black arrows between.          – From Mapping, a vertical black arrow drops down (~90 px) to “TS Insertion”.        Lower row (training-sequence path):          TS Generation (pink rectangle) → TS Insertion (pink rectangle below Mapping).          – Horizontal arrow between them.      • Ensure both rows perfect alignment.    6. Subfigure (c) – “Rx DSP” internal flow      • Draw a thin solid black rectangle enclosing.      • Title “Rx DSP” right-aligned near top-border.      • Immediately on the far left draw a tall blue rectangle labeled “ADC / OSC” (w 170 px, h 150 px).      • Two separate process paths originate from this block:        A. Estimation Process (upper path) – enclosed by a fine dashed rounded border:           – Place three blue rounded rectangles in series:             1. Coarse Framing             2. 2D-Search             3. Joint Estimation           – Each ≈ 220 px × 78 px, 30 px spacing, connected by black arrows.           – At the right edge of this dashed border, vertically stack the text “CD, FO, TO” (small caps, 22 pt).        B. Decoding Process (lower path) – its own dashed rounded border.           – Five blue rounded rectangles in sequence:             1. CDC             2. FOC             3. Synchronization (wider – 280 px)             4. LMS Equalization             5. CPR           – Same arrow spacing.      • A short vertical black arrow comes from the “ADC / OSC” block’s mid-height to each dashed process border.    7. Miscellaneous details      • Rounded rectangles corner radius ≈ 18 px.      • All internal dashed borders use a finer dash (10 px dash, 8 px gap).      • Drop-shadow beneath every colored block: subtle gray (#A8A8A8, 30 % opacity, offset 4 px x 4 px, blur 6 px).      • Arrow heads uniformly sized, fill black, stroke none.      • Maintain equal vertical alignment of blocks within each row for a clean professional look.    Generate the illustration at 300 dpi so that it is publication-ready for an IEEE-style optics communication paper."
t2i_image_caption_116="The image–generation tool (extremely detailed):  “Create a clean, vector–style illustration suitable for a scientific paper (white background, very thin #333333 stroke on every shape).  The canvas is horizontally oriented.  It is divided into two main vertical regions:    1) LEFT HALF (Encoder + Predictor)   2) RIGHT HALF (Decoder)    A very light warm-gray (RGB≈255,250,240) rounded rectangle (6 pt corner radius, 1 pt #333 outline) encloses each of the two regions.  The two enclosing rectangles do not touch; they are separated by a narrow white gutter.   TOP-LEVEL INPUT / OUTPUT ICONS  • Centered 20 px above the left enclosure draw a bright-blue (#2288E8) flat icon: a 72 × 35 px rectangle with slightly rounded corners.  Inside it, centered, place a white loud-speaker glyph (cone and two curved sound waves).  Under this icon write the word “Audio” in bold, 9 pt, black.   • Centered 20 px above the right enclosure draw another bright-blue 72 × 35 px rounded rectangle.  Inside place a white “document” glyph (rectangle with a folded upper-right corner and three horizontal lines).  Under it write “Text” in bold, 9 pt, black.   COMMON GRAPHIC CONVENTIONS  • All functional blocks are color-coded rounded rectangles (corner-radius 4 pt, 1 pt #333 outline) 140 px wide, 45 px high.   • Colors:     – light sky-blue (#B8D4FF) for attention or convolutional blocks     – light spring-green (#C7F0C7) for feed-forward or linear blocks     – pale maize yellow (#FFF3A8) for “Norm & Add” and “CIF” style blocks     – apricot orange (#FFD9A5) for multi-head attention blocks or Sigmoid     – lavender (#E5D5F6) for “Concat”     – light pastel red (#FFCDD2) for “FSMN”     – neutral light gray (#E8E8E8) for “Preprocess”   • Arrows are 1 pt black lines with solid triangular heads.   • A dashed arrow uses 2 pt black dashes.   • Element labels are center-aligned, 9 pt, semi-bold, black.   DETAILED LAYOUT – LEFT ENCLOSURE  A) Beneath the “Audio” icon leave a 20 px gap then draw a 140 × 45 px light-gray block labeled “Preprocess”.   B) 30 px below it place the ENCODER STACK:       • Draw a vertical bracket on the left (thin 1 pt line, height ≈110 px) that covers exactly two layered blocks.  At the middle of the bracket write “× L” in 8 pt italic.      • Inside the stack draw two blocks aligned on the same vertical center:          1. upper sky-blue block labeled “MSA layer”          2. 10 px below it a spring-green block labeled “FF layer”      • At the mid-gap between them draw a small 12 px white circle with 1 pt black outline and a black “⊕” plus symbol, showing the residual connection point.      • Draw a down-arrow from Preprocess into the top of the MSA block.      • Draw a down-arrow leaving the ⊕ circle towards the bottom of the FF layer.    C) Immediately below the encoder stack (10 px gap) place a light-yellow “⊕” circle identical to the one inside the stack (this is the overall residual output).  D) PREDICTOR sub-module (enclosed by a slightly darker warm-gray (#FDF6EF) rounded rectangle 160 px wide, 220 px tall, 1 pt outline).  Inside, from top to bottom with 15 px vertical gaps:      1. sky-blue block labeled “Conv layer” (center top of this enclosure).      2. From its bottom center draw a vertical arrow splitting:           • Straight down into a spring-green block labeled “Linear” → arrow down into an apricot-orange block labeled “Sigmoid”.           • 30 px to the right, a diagonal arrow feeds into a tall vertical light-yellow block (140 × 90 px) labeled “CIF”.      3. From the right edge of the CIF block draw a long horizontal arrow (length ~120 px) exiting the Predictor enclosure toward the right enclosure (Decoder).      4. A dashed black arrow (2 pt dashes) from the bottom of the Sigmoid block points diagonally upward/right to merge into the mid-height of the CIF block, signifying gating.  Label the lower-left outside corner of this small enclosure with the bold word “Predictor” in 8 pt, dark gray.   DETAILED LAYOUT – RIGHT ENCLOSURE (Decoder)  This region begins where the horizontal arrow from CIF arrives on the left edge.  Inside, lay out blocks top-to-bottom with 18 px gaps, some with skip-connections:  1. A spring-green block labeled “FF layer”.  Incoming arrow attaches at its top-center.   2. Under it a light-yellow block labeled “Norm & Add”.  A slim back-connection arrow (90 ° elbow) emerges from the right side of the FF layer, descends and enters this Norm & Add block from the left, depicting residual addition.   3. A light pastel-red block labeled “FSMN”.  Arrow down from Norm & Add.   4. Another light-yellow “Norm & Add” block.  A right-side residual elbow arrow comes from the left edge of FSMN back into this Norm & Add.   5. Two apricot-orange blocks labeled “MHA”, positioned side-by-side, 30 px apart, at the same vertical level, with equal widths (115 px instead of 140 so both fit).  Arrows:        • The central down arrow from the upper Norm & Add splits into two, feeding the top of each MHA block.        • A back-residual arrow exits the right side of each MHA, bends downward and inward to merge into the next block.   6. Directly beneath the two MHA blocks draw one lavender block spanning their combined width (≈260 px) labeled “Concat”.  Two vertical arrows descend from each MHA into this block.   7. Below Concat draw another light-yellow block labeled “Norm & Add”.  A slim back-edge residual arrow emerges from the right edge of Concat, loops down and into this block’s left edge.   8. From the bottom center of this final Norm & Add draw a long vertical arrow that exits the enclosure and travels upward (~90 px) to the “Text” icon at the very top-center of the right half.  Put the bold word “Decoder” (8 pt, dark gray) centered under the right rounded rectangle.   EXTRA NOTES FOR STYLE  • Use a consistent 4 pt gap around every block inside its enclosure.   • Maintain perfectly vertical or horizontal arrows with 90 ° bends; keep spacing symmetric for a clean technical look.   • Fonts: match Helvetica or another modern sans-serif.   • No drop-shadows, gradients, or embellishments; flat colors only.   • Entire diagram fits comfortably on an 833 × 768 px canvas.  The result should be an exact, publication-quality replica of the described architecture figure.”"

t2i_image_caption_118="Ultra-detailed image-generation prompt:  “Generate a clean, publication-quality vector diagram (white background) that depicts a dual-path deep-learning architecture. Use a classic scientific style: crisp 2-pt pure-black outlines, 2-pt pure-black arrows with filled arrowheads, Times New Roman font, 44-pt for block titles, 40-pt for the word ‘Layer’ or ‘ResBlock’, boldface exactly as described, and perfectly centred text inside each block. Overall canvas aspect ratio ≈ 3:2 (landscape); leave generous white margins on all sides.  Layout overview 1. Left vertical backbone (centre-left side):    a. Downward arrow (length ≈ 1.3 block heights) starting at top margin.       • Arrow label “input” in 38-pt Times, regular, lowercase, placed just to the right of the arrow’s shaft, horizontally centred on the arrow’s mid-point.    b. Block 1: rectangle 220 px tall × 580 px wide, fill colour #c4e3d7 (pastel sea-foam), positioned so its top edge sits directly under the arrow head.       • Text: “Resnet(Initial Layer)”, where “Resnet” is bold, “(Initial Layer)” is regular.    c. 40 px vertical gap, then a short downward arrow.    d. Block 2: rectangle same size, fill colour #ffeaea (very light pink).       • Text: “Attention Layer”, “Attention” bold, “Layer” regular.    e. 40 px gap, then short downward arrow.    f. Block 3: rectangle same size and colour as Block 1 (#c4e3d7).       • Text: “Resnet(Final Layer)”, “Resnet” bold, parenthetical words regular.    g. From the centre-right edge of Block 3, draw a horizontal black arrow (length ≈ 450 px) straight to the right until it is flush with the vertical centre-line of the residual-addition circle described later. This is the skip connection.  2. Right branch (centre-right side), vertically aligned so its first block is level with the horizontal centreline of Block 1 on the left:    a. From the right edge of the vertical backbone (exactly at the midpoint between Block 1 and Block 2), draw a 240 px horizontal arrow pointing right into Block 4 (this forms the branch split).    b. Block 4 (top of right column): rectangle 200 px tall × 530 px wide, fill colour #c9a6d8 (light lavender).       • Text: “GraphResBlock”, “Graph” bold, “ResBlock” regular.    c. 35 px gap, then downward arrow.    d. Block 5: rectangle same size, fill colour #cfe0ff (soft sky blue).       • Text: “TemporalResBlock”, “Temporal” bold, “ResBlock” regular.    e. 35 px gap, then downward arrow.    f. Block 6: rectangle same size and colour as Block 4 (#c9a6d8).       • Text identical to Block 4.    g. 35 px gap, then downward arrow.    h. Block 7: rectangle same size and colour as Block 5 (#cfe0ff).       • Text identical to Block 5.    i. 35 px gap, then a short downward arrow terminating at the top of the residual-addition circle.  3. Residual-addition symbol:    • Circle diameter 160 px, 2-pt black outline, white fill, centred horizontally under Block 7.    • Inside the circle place a plus sign “+” drawn as two 2-pt black lines, vertical and horizontal, length 80 px each, intersecting at the centre.    • The downward arrow from Block 7 meets the top of this circle; the horizontal skip-connection arrow from Block 3 meets the leftmost point of the circle.    • A horizontal arrow exits the right side of the circle (same style) and extends 290 px.       – Place the label “output” (38-pt Times, regular) just above this exiting arrow, right-aligned with the circle’s right edge.  Styling and spacing details • All rectangles have 14-px corner radius (subtle rounding). • Internal text is perfectly centred both horizontally and vertically within each rectangle. • Use exactly the specified colours:     – Sea-foam (#c4e3d7) for both Resnet blocks.     – Very light pink (#ffeaea) for the Attention block.     – Lavender (#c9a6d8) for GraphResBlock rectangles.     – Sky blue (#cfe0ff) for TemporalResBlock rectangles. • Arrowheads are equilateral triangles, side length 26 px, filled black. • Vertical alignment: centres of all right-column rectangles lie on the same vertical guide; similarly for left-column rectangles. • Ensure equal vertical gaps (40 px in left column, 35 px in right column) for visual balance.  The final image should look like a precise, high-resolution figure ready for inclusion in a peer-reviewed machine-learning paper.”"
t2i_image_caption_119="Recreating the scientific illustration (describe in second-person so that an image-generation tool can follow it):  1. Canvas & General Layout      • Create a landscape-oriented canvas with an aspect ratio of roughly 3:2 (about 930 × 660 px in the reference).      • Visually divide the canvas vertically into two equal horizontal parts: the upper half titled “Gloss-Based”, the lower half titled “Gloss-Free”.      • Draw one solid horizontal separator line exactly at the mid-height (1 px black).      • Inside the lower half, draw an additional horizontal separator: a black dashed line (dash length ≈ 12 px, gap ≈ 8 px) located one-third of the way down from the solid mid-line.  2. Coordinate Axis (BLEU-4 scale)      • At the top-most edge, center an x-axis arrow pointing right.      • Label this axis “BLEU-4” near the arrow head (bold, black, small caps).      • Place tick marks at 0.0, 12.0, 16.0, 20.0, 24.0, 28.0 positions.      • Mark “0.0” directly above the y-axis break symbol (zig-zag) at the left; subsequent numeric labels go above their ticks in 4-unit intervals, sans-serif 10-pt black.  3. Left-hand Y labels      • On the extreme left, vertically center the words “Gloss-Based” (top half) and “Gloss-Free” (lower half). Use a bold, 20 pt, rotated 90° counter-clockwise orientation so the text reads bottom-to-top.      • Use black for “Gloss-Based”, black for “Gloss-Free”, and highlight the word “Ours” (placed just left of the dashed line, colored red, 16 pt bold italics).  4. Color legend (encoded inside the workflow)      • All blocks coded as “Learnable” are colored pastel-orange (#F3C5A4).      • All blocks marked “Frozen” are pastel-blue (#AFC9F5).      • Auxiliary task blocks are pastel-green (#B8DDB5).      • Draw a small in-line legend in the bottom-left corner (optional; not present on the original but reference: beige ≜ Learnable, blue ≜ Frozen). Font 9 pt.  5. Module Representations (rectangular nodes)      a) Upper Gloss-Based pipeline (two-stage):         • Block 1 (learnable): centered horizontally, draw a rounded rectangle (rx=8 px) 150 px wide, 55 px high, filled pastel-orange. Centered text: “Visual Encoder” (bold, 12 pt black).         • Directly beneath Block 1, partially overlapping downward by 15 px, draw Block 2 (frozen): same size, pastel-blue, same label “Visual Encoder”.         • To the right of Block 2 place Block 3 (learnable LLM): pastel-orange, 150 × 55 px, label “LLM”.         • To the far right of Block 3 place a thin black outline rectangle 110 × 40 px, white interior, label “spoken sentence”.        • Slightly above Block 3, aligned to the right edge of Block 1, place Block Aux: pastel-green rounded rectangle 160 × 45 px, label “Gloss-based CSLR”.     b) Dotted improvement arrow (Gloss-Based):         • Draw a black dotted diagonal arrow (dot 4 px gap 6 px) starting above Block 2, passing through its center, then across Blocks 3 and Aux, ending at a red filled circle (radius 8 px) positioned near BLEU-4 ≈ 28 on the x-axis.         • Place a smaller red filled circle (radius 8 px) on the same dotted arrow just above the mid-separator (approx. BLEU-4 ≈ 12).     c) Middle Gloss-Free baseline pipeline:         • Immediately under the solid mid-line, create a single learnable “Visual Encoder” (orange) 150 × 55 px.         • To its right, an orange “LLM” block; to its right, the white “spoken sentence” target block.         • Feed arrows: thin black solid arrows connecting left-to-right between all blocks.         • Input arrow: on far left, a white bold label “Sign video” inside a black outline rectangle 85 × 35 px; arrow enters first Visual Encoder.         • The dotted diagonal arrow described above intersects this middle encoder block and continues to the red dot (indicating inferior performance).     d) Lower (“Ours”) pipeline beneath the dashed line:         • Two-stage stack as in upper pipeline, but substitute the middle orange block label “Light-T” (same size).         • Place Light-T directly to the right of the upper frozen “Visual Encoder”.         • To Light-T’s right, a pastel-green rectangle 200 × 45 px labelled “Video-Grounded Text Generation”.         • Beneath those three, duplicate an orange “Visual Encoder” feeding an orange “LLM” feeding a white “spoken sentence”, exactly mirroring the upper-most gloss-based design.         • Draw a red five-point star (radius ~14 px) centered on Light-T (partly obscuring its label) to indicate novelty.  6. Connection & Flow arrows      • Every block is connected by straight, thin, solid black arrows left-to-right.      • From each “Sign video” box, two parallel short horizontal arrows enter (upper and lower visual encoders in stacks).      • Between vertically stacked encoders, draw a small black curved arrow labelled “Parameters inheritance” (10 pt italic-black) pointing from the lower edge of the upper orange encoder to the upper edge of the lower blue encoder in both stacks.  7. Fonts & Styles      • Use a clean sans-serif font (Helvetica/Arial).      • Main labels inside blocks: 12 pt bold black.      • Axis labels/ticks: 10 pt.      • Section tags (Gloss-Based, Gloss-Free): 20 pt bold.      • Word “Ours” in red (#D10E0E), italic, 16 pt.  8. Background & Misc      • Pure white canvas background.      • All arrows are solid black except the diagonal dotted performance arrow.      • All dashed or dotted rules are black.  With this explicit spatial, color, and textual specification, the generated graphic should replicate the professional scientific illustration faithfully."

Three vertical zones inside the System container      • Divide the interior into three equal-width, side-by-side rounded rectangles (§ corner radius 12 px, stroke identical to the parent):        a. Left zone: “Client” – fill pastel sky-blue (#cfe0ff, 70 % opacity).        b. Middle zone: “Server” – fill pastel salmon-pink (#f5c7c7, 70 % opacity).        c. Right zone: “Evaluation” – fill pastel mint-green (#cfe9cf, 70 % opacity).      • All three zones are vertically centered, height ≈ 90 % of parent.      • Place the zone titles (“Client”, “Server”, “Evaluation”) in small caps, bold, dark-slate-grey font, 17 pt, horizontally centered at the top inside each zone.  3. Functional blocks (rounded rectangles)      Color code:   yellow = Federated Learning blocks,  lavender = Deep-Leakage-Attack blocks.      i. Client zone (top→bottom, vertically spaced evenly)         1. “Compute Gradients” – yellow fill (#ffeb9c), label 15 pt bold.         2. “Global Model” – yellow fill.         3. “Private Data Batch” – yellow fill.      ii. Server zone (top→bottom)         4. “Deep Leakage Attack” – lavender fill (#d4bdf5).         5. “Recovered Data Batch” – lavender fill.         6. “Global Model Update” – yellow fill.      iii. Evaluation zone (top→bottom)         7. “Model Metrics” – lavender fill.         8. “Intermediate Metrics” – lavender fill.         9. “Overall Metrics” – lavender fill.       • All block widths identical (~60 % of their parent zone width).      • Block heights ≈ 13 % of zone height; corner radius 10 px; internal horizontal padding 6 px.      • Use a consistent medium-grey stroke (#555, 1.5 px) for all blocks.  4. Directed process arrows      Stroke color solid black (#000), arrowheads filled black, length-adjust dynamically to connectors.      a. Client (vertical)         • Solid arrow from “Private Data Batch” ↑ to “Global Model”.         • Solid arrow from “Global Model” ↑ to “Compute Gradients”.      b. Client → Server communication         • Solid horizontal arrow from the right edge of “Compute Gradients” → left edge of “Deep Leakage Attack”.         • Solid horizontal arrow from right edge of “Global Model” → left edge of “Global Model Update”.         • Solid horizontal arrow from right edge of “Private Data Batch” → left edge of “Global Model Update”.      c. Server internal vertical arrows         • Solid ↓ arrow “Deep Leakage Attack” → “Recovered Data Batch”.         • Solid ↓ arrow “Recovered Data Batch” → “Global Model Update”.      d. Server → Evaluation         • Solid horizontal arrow from right edge of “Recovered Data Batch” → left edge of “Intermediate Metrics”.         • Solid horizontal arrow from right edge of “Deep Leakage Attack” → left edge of “Model Metrics”.      e. Evaluation internal vertical arrow         • Light-grey dotted ↓ arrow (stroke 2 px, dot-spacing 5 px) from “Intermediate Metrics” → “Overall Metrics”.  5. Attack-rate arrows (dashed)      • Black dashed arrow (stroke 1.5 px, dash 8 px gap 6 px) from right edge of “Compute Gradients” → left edge of “Recovered Data Batch”.      • Dashed arrow from right edge of “Private Data Batch” → left edge of “Recovered Data Batch”.    6. Process Key legend (bottom bar)      • Place a separate rounded rectangle legend (corner radius 15 px) spanning entire width at the very bottom inside parent frame, height 75 px, fill light-grey (#e7e9ed).      • Inside, align symbols left-to-right:        – Solid black arrow followed by label “Every training iteration”.        – Black dashed arrow, label “Every attack rate”.        – Light-grey dotted arrow, label “Once at the end”.        – Small 25 × 15 px yellow box, label “Federated Learning Process”.        – Small 25 × 15 px lavender box, label “Deep Leakage Attack Process”.      • Text 13 pt, dark-slate-grey.  7. Visual style details      • All text in sans-serif (e.g., Open-Sans or Helvetica).      • Ensure consistent vertical alignment and equal spacing between blocks inside each zone.      • Use subtle drop shadow (blur 4 px, opacity 15 %) for each zone to create mild depth.      • Keep diagram crisp, professional, suitable for a journal figure."

The final image must look like a polished, camera-ready figure in a machine-learning paper, faithfully reproducing every color, label, arrow, and grouping described above."
t2i_image_caption_122="Prompt – Detailed scientific-diagram description for an image generator  Create a crisp, vector-style, high-resolution schematic (A4 portrait, white background) that depicts the inner structure of a “Cross-Attention Block” used in transformer networks.  Use clean, 1-pt black strokes for all contours and arrows, rounded rectangle nodes with 3-pt corner radii, and a light pastel colour palette to clearly differentiate every functional module.  The drawing consists of two vertically stacked parts:   PART-1  (BOTTOM, high-level overview)  1.  Centre a wide, light-steel-blue (#cbd9f3) rounded rectangle labelled       “Cross Attention Block” in bold, 10-pt black serif font.       • Width ≈ 55 % of page, height ≈ 9 % of page.       • Draw subtle vertical gradient fill (top #d9e2f8 → bottom #bcd0f0).  2.  Beneath this rectangle, centre the text “× 6” in 9-pt italic black, indicating six stacked blocks.  3.  To the left of the large rectangle, draw a vertical stack of five small empty squares       • Square side ≈ 6 mm, 1-pt green (#4da450) stroke, no fill.       • The five squares are equally spaced inside a dashed, rounded rectangle outline         (same green stroke, 1-pt dash pattern “4-pt gap”).         The enclosing dashed rectangle’s corners have 2-pt radius.       • Under the dashed outline, left-aligned, write “Input Query” in 9-pt black.  4.  To the right of the large rectangle, draw the symmetric counterpart: a vertical stack       of five mustard-yellow (#efc550) stroked empty squares inside a dashed outline       of the same colour.  Beneath that, right-aligned, write “Input Value/Key”.  5.  Draw a single black arrow (1-pt, arrow-head) from the green dashed block to the       left edge-centre of the “Cross Attention Block” rectangle, and another arrow from       the yellow dashed block to the right edge-centre of the same rectangle.  6.  From the top-centre of the “Cross Attention Block” rectangle, draw a broad       upward-pointing triangular wedge (isosceles,≈40 mm tall, base width equals rectangle width).       Fill the wedge with a vertical blue gradient (#d0e0ff at bottom → fully transparent at top).       This wedge visually zooms into the detailed sub-diagram above.   PART-2  (TOP, detailed internal layout)  Surround the entire upper diagram with a black dashed rounded rectangle   (corner radius 4 pt, 1-pt stroke, dash pattern “4-pt gap”).  This bounding box’s width   is identical to the “Cross Attention Block” rectangle; its top sits ≈15 mm below the page’s top.  Inside this dashed frame, align all operations on an invisible left-to-right grid, using   horizontal arrows for data flow and circles for residual additions/multiplications.  A) LOWER SECTION (projection & embedding)    Left branch – Query path:    1.  Bottom-most left node: rounded rectangle, white fill, green border (#4da450), text “Query Proj.”.          Size ≈ 24 mm × 8 mm.  Outgoing arrow straight up.     2.  Above it (5 mm gap) another rounded rectangle, pastel blue fill (#dae2f7), text “LayerNorm”.     3.  Above that (5 mm gap) a light-green rectangle (#cfead2), text in italic “E_Q”.     Right branch – Value/Key path (mirrors left):    1.  Bottom-most right node: rounded rectangle, pale butter-yellow fill (#fff4d0), border #d6c483,          text “Value/Key Proj.”.     2.  Above it (5 mm gap) pastel blue rectangle, text “LayerNorm”.     3.  From this rectangle draw TWO vertical arrows splitting upward:          • Left split goes to a pale-salmon rectangle (#f5d7c4) labelled “E_V”.          • Right split goes to a mustard-yellow rectangle (#f0cc55) labelled “E_K”.          Both rectangles are horizontally centred at the same height as E_Q,          with E_K between E_Q and E_V.  B) ATTENTION MECHANICS    1.  Place a multiplication node: a white circle (diameter 6 mm, 1-pt black stroke) with          bold black “×” inside, centred horizontally between E_Q (left) and E_V (right).          • Draw an arrow from E_Q into its left side.          • Draw an arrow from E_V into its right side.     2.  Immediately above the “×”, place a white rectangle with black border, text “Softmax”.          • Arrow from the “×” up into this Softmax box.          • Another arrow goes from E_K’s top into the left side of the Softmax box.  C) LINEAR PROJECTION & RESIDUAL    1.  Above the Softmax box (8 mm gap) another white circle with “×”.          • Left input: arrow from Softmax output.          • Right input: arrow from E_V (right).     2.  Above that circle (5 mm) a pastel blue rounded rectangle labelled “Linear Proj.”.  D) FEED-FORWARD & SECOND RESIDUAL    1.  Above “Linear Proj.” place a white circle containing “+”.          • Left input: arrow from Linear Proj.          • Right input: LONG horizontal arrow that skips from the left border of the dashed frame            (originating at the “LayerNorm” under “Query Proj.”) directly into the plus circle,            forming the first residual connection.     2.  Above this plus circle (5 mm) a pastel-blue rectangle “LayerNorm”.     3.  Above it a white circle with “+”.          • Left input: arrow from LayerNorm.          • Right input: LONG horizontal arrow that starts at the left border of the dashed frame            just above E_Q, bypassing intermediate nodes (second residual connection).     4.  Above this second plus circle, a pastel-blue rounded rectangle “FFN”.     5.  Finally, above “FFN”, a pastel-blue rectangle “LayerNorm”; an arrow exits its top and pierces         the dashed bounding box, indicating output to subsequent network stages.  E) ARROW STYLE    • All arrows are solid black, 1-pt, triangular heads.      • Residual arrows that bypass layers run parallel to the main flow, exactly aligned on horizontal        guides, with right-angle turns where needed.  F) TEXT FONTS    • Node labels: 9-pt bold serif.      • Subscripts in E_Q, E_K, E_V are italic.      • All capitals exactly match those shown.  G) COLOUR SUMMARY    – Light-steel-blue nodes (LayerNorm, Linear Proj., FFN)  : #cbd9f3      – Query-side auxiliary rectangles (Query Proj., E_Q)      : border #4da450, fill #eaf6e7 (Proj), #cfead2 (E_Q)      – Value/Key side auxiliary rectangles                    : border #d6c483, fill #fff4d0 (Proj), #f5d7c4 (E_V), #f0cc55 (E_K)      – Operator circles (×, +)                                : white fill, black stroke      – Softmax rectangle                                      : white fill, black stroke      – Dashed bounding boxes                                  : black stroke, 4-pt dash pattern  Ensure the entire graphic is perfectly symmetric, lines are pixel-sharp, colour pallet pastel and publication-ready."

Centre-top, place a 48 × 48 px square icon with 3-px #E88A04 stroke; inside draw a simple orange mountain-with-sun line-art (two triangular peaks and a circle in the upper-right). Put “Input Image” (black text, 12 pt) centred directly above the icon. 2. Draw a straight 40 px vertical arrow (black) down from the bottom edge of the icon to a pale-yellow rounded rectangle (120 px wide, 36 px tall) labelled “Patch Embedding” (centre-aligned label).  3. Inside a LARGE dashed rectangle (top-left aligned such that its top touches the bottom of the “Patch Embedding” box):    • Box height ≈120 px, width just sufficient to include the whole chain; 8-px-dash outline.    • Top-right outside corner, place the text “× L layers” (italic, 11 pt). 4. Within that dashed rectangle, lay out a horizontal sequence of 4 rounded rectangles:    a. “LayerNorm” (green) 110 × 36 px    b. “Multi-Head Self-Attention” (light salmon) 180 × 36 px       – Between (a) and (b) place a right-pointing black arrow.    c. Directly after (b) place a 24-px-diameter lavender circle with a bold white “+” sign centred; a short right-pointing arrow enters the circle from (b).       – A black arrow exits the circle to (d).    d. Second “LayerNorm” (green) 110 × 36 px    e. “Weightless Network” (steel blue) 170 × 36 px       – Black arrow from (d) to (e).    f. Immediately after (e) place another 24-px lavender “+” circle, same style.       – Black arrow exits this circle to the rightmost edge of the dashed rectangle (signifying continuation to next layer).  5. LEADER LINE to bottom block:    • From the mid-height of the “Weightless Network” rectangle, draw a ~45-degree downward right-angled dotted arrow (black, dot pattern) that terminates on the left edge of the bottom dotted rectangle, pointing inside.  BOTTOM BLOCK (Zoom-in of Weightless Network) 1. A tall upright dotted rectangle (~600 px wide × 220 px tall) with a 2-px dot pattern, positioned below the top block and horizontally centred. 2. Inside, place five vertical, equally spaced bars:    a. LEFTMOST lavender rounded rectangle (130 × 160 px) labelled (line-break)        “Activations        Flattened        Out        (row-wise)”       – Black right-pointing arrow from centre-right of this box to the next bar.    b. Orange rounded rectangle (130 × 160 px) labelled “Thermometer Encodings”.       – Two diagonal arrows exit its right edge: one to the top third of LUT Layer 1, one to the bottom third of LUT Layer 2.    c. First light-yellow rounded rectangle (130 × 160 px) labelled “LUT Layer 1”.       – Two arrows: one straight right to LUT Layer 2 mid-section, one diagonal to top of “Ternary Summation”.    d. Second light-yellow rounded rectangle (130 × 160 px) labelled “LUT Layer 2”.       – One arrow straight right into centre of “Ternary Summation”.    e. Cyan rounded rectangle (130 × 160 px) labelled “Ternary Summation”.       – Three black arrows enter its left edge (from Thermometer Encodings, LUT 1, LUT 2).       – From its right edge, draw three short parallel arrows exiting the dotted box, pointing into empty space; beside these arrows, vertically, write “Latent Space” (black, 12 pt) so the text is parallel to the right border, reading top-to-bottom.  TYPOGRAPHY & STYLE • All box labels: Title-case, centre-aligned, 11 pt bold. • Parenthetical text “(row-wise)” is 9 pt regular. • ‘+’ signs inside circles: white, 16 pt, heavy weight. • Arrowheads: solid triangular, 8 px long.  Final composition should look perfectly symmetrical, crisp, and publication-ready, suitable for a machine-learning architecture figure in a top-tier conference paper.”"
t2i_image_caption_124="An illustration generator:  “Create a clean, vector-style scientific diagram on a pure-white background that is 3 : 2 in aspect ratio (≈1600 px width × 1066 px height).   The drawing is split into two horizontal panels of equal height, separated by 50 px of blank space.   Use a coherent pastel color palette, 6 px-wide deep-black arrows, and rounded rectangles with a 4 px corner radius for blocks.   All text is in bold, black, sans-serif (Arial or Helvetica). Block labels are centre-aligned, rendered in 24 pt; panel titles are 36 pt.       TOP PANEL – “Conventional Transformer”    1. Title:      • Centre the text “Conventional Transformer” 40 px below the top edge.  2. Processing path:      • Arrange three vertically oriented rounded rectangles left-to-right, centred vertically inside this panel, each 260 px tall × 120 px wide, with 120 px horizontal gaps between them.      • Block #1 (left): pastel-peach fill (#FFE7C5), 2 px dark-gold stroke (#D9A530).        – Text (rotated 90° clockwise) reads “Multi-Head (Masked) Attention” stacked with deliberate line breaks after “Multi-Head” and “(Masked)”.      • Block #2 (centre): pastel-green fill (#D0EBCF), 2 px mid-green stroke (#5E9B5E).        – Text (horizontal) reads “Add & Norm”.      • Block #3 (right): pastel-rose fill (#F8CCCC), 2 px muted-red stroke (#E37B7B), AND an overlaid black dashed X: two diagonal dashed lines (dash 12 px / gap 8 px, 4 px width) connecting opposing corners to indicate deletion.        – Text (rotated 90° clockwise) reads “Multi-Layer Perceptron”.  3. Arrows:      • Main dataflow: a thick black arrow (6 px) enters from the extreme left, meets Block #1, exits Block #1, then enters Block #2, exits Block #2, enters Block #3, exits Block #3, and terminates at the right boundary of the panel.      • Residual (skip) path: starting at the left input arrow’s tail, draw a 6 px black line that climbs vertically 50 px, runs horizontally above the blocks, drops 50 px to meet the right edge of Block #2, merges with the forward arrow between Block #2 and Block #3.      • Another residual: from the output of Block #2, a black line climbs 50 px, crosses Block #3’s top edge, drops 50 px to merge with the main stream immediately after Block #3, before the final right-hand exit arrow.     MID-PANEL CONNECTOR    • Centered between panels place a medium-sized downward-pointing arrow (outline 4 px, fill #AED0FF) indicating conceptual replacement.   • Arrow shaft length 40 px, head height 40 px.     BOTTOM PANEL – “Quasi-Weightless Transformer”    1. Title:      • Place the text “Quasi-Weightless Transformer” exactly mirrored beneath the top title, 40 px above the blocks.  2. Processing path (same geometry and positions as top panel):      • Block #1: identical to top panel’s Block #1 (peach “Multi-Head (Masked) Attention”).      • Block #2: identical pastel-green “Add & Norm”.      • Block #3: light-lavender fill (#D9CCF2), 2 px muted-violet stroke (#9676C7), label (rotated 90° clockwise) reads “Weightless Block”; NO dashed X.      • Block #4 (far right, same color as Block #2): pastel-green “Add & Norm” (260 px tall × 120 px wide) spaced 120 px to the right of Block #3.  3. Arrows:      • Main forward path: same style as above flowing through four blocks.      • Residual paths:        – From left input, up 50 px → across above Block #1 → down to merge at entry of Block #2.        – From output of Block #2, up 50 px → across Block #3 → down to merge at entry of Block #4.      • All arrows 6 px black.  Overall look: minimalist, uncluttered, precise alignment, consistent stroke widths, pastel fills, scientific-presentation quality."

Important micro-details • Every joining of multiple arrows into a node must attach at distinct anchor points to avoid visual overlap.   • Arrow labels (“YES”, “NO”) always sit immediately outside the path, never blocking the node interior.   • Use subtle 15 % shadow (#00000040, 12 px blur, 7 px offset) under every node to add depth, but not under arrows or the outer frame.   • Keep equal vertical spacing (120 px arrow length) between stacked nodes for perfect visual rhythm.  The resulting figure is a crisp, publication-ready systems-flow diagram faithfully mirroring the original reference in both geometry and colour scheme."

CANVAS LAYOUT (left to right)  TOP SIGNAL PATH (centered vertically at 25 % canvas height) 1. At x = 10 %, y = 25 %: a 40 px-radius green circle containing a single-stroke sine wave (one period) – label “Input” above, left-aligned in sans-serif, 24 pt. 2. From the circle’s right-hand tangent, a horizontal black arrow 60 px long to… 3. A blue-outlined, rounded-rectangle ADC block (width 110 px, height 70 px) centered at x = 25 %, y = 25 %, text “ADC” centered. 4. From ADC’s right edge, a black arrow 80 px long then splits with a sharp 90° T-junction into two identical vertical branches (one up, one down), creating a “fork”. 5. Those two branches feed two identical mixer icons:    • Upper mixer: centered at x = 45 %, y = 25 %.    • Lower mixer: centered at x = 45 %, y = 55 %.    Each mixer is a 60 px-diameter blue circle, inside is a blue “×” symbol filling ~80 % of the circle. 6. From each mixer, a horizontal black arrow 120 px into a low-pass filter icon:    • The LPF is a blue square outline (70 px side). Inside, draw a thick blue right-triangular slanted response (flat on left, slanted down to the right) occupying the top half.    • Upper LPF center: x = 68 %, y = 25 %.    • Lower LPF center: x = 68 %, y = 55 %. 7. From each LPF’s right edge, a short (40 px) horizontal arrow. At the rightmost tip add the labels:    • Upper arrow labeled “I” (italic, 20 pt) just above the arrow.    • Lower arrow labeled “Q” just below the arrow. 8. Both arrows converge into a single blue-outlined rounded rectangle “Arctan” block (width 130 px, height 80 px) centered at x = 85 %, y = 40 % (midpoint between I and Q lines). Join the two input arrows with 45° bends so they enter the Arctan’s left edge at upper and lower thirds. 9. From the Arctan block’s right edge, a final horizontal black arrow 60 px long terminating in the word “Phase” (bold, sans-serif 24 pt) at x ≈ 96 %, y = 40 %.  BOTTOM REFERENCE PATH (centered vertically at 75 % canvas height) 1. At x = 10 %, y = 75 %: another 40 px-radius green circle with sine wave; label “REF” above. 2. Horizontal black arrow 60 px into an amber-outlined rounded rectangle “Clock” (width 110 px, height 70 px) centered at x = 25 %, y = 75 %. 3. From Clock’s right edge, arrow 70 px to an amber-outlined circle (radius 38 px) containing a green sinusoid; text “NCO” in bold, sans-serif, centered below the circle. Circle center at x = 40 %, y = 75 %. 4. Two black arrows leave the NCO:    • One arrow goes straight up 45 °, reaches y = 25 % at x = 55 %, then levels horizontally leftward 20 px into the UPPER mixer. Position the label “sin(2π f_NCO)” (italic serif) above this slanted segment.    • The second arrow goes straight up (vertical) to y = 55 % at x = 55 %, then turns 90° left 20 px into the LOWER mixer. Place the label “cos(2π f_NCO)” slightly below this vertical segment.    Both arrows are black with filled triangular heads.  ARROWS AND JUNCTIONS • All arrows have filled triangular heads (base width ~10 px). • Where lines split or meet mixers, use crisp 90° elbows with 5 px radius.  OVERALL STYLE • All shapes and strokes anti-aliased, aligned to pixel grid for sharp printing. • Plenty of white space around every block; do not allow any text to overlap shapes. • Maintain consistently 20 px gap between parallel horizontal paths (I vs. Q) and 40 px vertical gap between the top and bottom subsystems.  The final result should look like a high-resolution IEEE conference block diagram.”"

Canvas layout (top to bottom):  1. Visual Perception Module      • Surround the whole block with a rounded rectangle (stroke #8000ff, the same purple used everywhere) 380 px wide, 150 px tall.      • Title “Visual Perception Module” centered at the top margin inside that frame, bold.      • Inside place three horizontally aligned white boxes, each 100 px wide, 30 px high, stroke black:           a. Left: “RGB Image”           b. Center: “Object Masks” (yellow fill #ffff99)           c. Right: “Depth Image”      • Below those, put two output boxes (same size) on two rows:           a.

t2i_image_caption_131="An illustration generator (English, extremely detailed and precise):  GENERAL CANVAS AND STYLE • Create a wide, landscape-oriented canvas with a white background, aspect ratio ≈ 2:1 (width about twice the height).   • Use a clean flat-design aesthetic, soft pastel colors, thin 2-pixel black outlines for every box, arrow and dashed frame, and no gradients.   • Sans-serif font (e.g., Helvetica or Arial), regular weight, black text, font size balanced so the longest label (“Sparse Vector Quantization”) fits neatly inside its box with small margins.   • Add a subtle 3-pixel radius corner rounding to every rectangle (inner and outer).   • There are two independent pipeline diagrams placed side-by-side, separated by a vertical black dashed divider line running the full height of the drawing, located at the exact horizontal midpoint of the canvas.  COLOR PALETTE (hex values) • Lavender-grey (#cfd8f6)  → “Normalization”, “De-normalization” boxes on both sides.   • Light teal (#7dc9c4)      → “Decoder” (left) and “Encoder” (right).   • Dusty pink (#f5c6c6)      → “Projection” modules.   • Light yellow-green (#e4ebc2) → “Vector Quantization” (left) and “Multi-Head Attention” (call-out).   • Pale yellow (#fde9b2)     → “Sparse Vector Quantization” (right).   • Deep teal (#0d8b78)       → “Transformer” (right).   • Very light steel blue for the tiny vertical bars in the “Patching” graphic (#b8d0f9).   • Outer containers use a translucent light-blue fill (#dff1ff) on the left and a very light warm-grey fill (#f1f1f1) on the right.  LEFT-HAND PIPELINE (Baseline) 1. Bottom label “Input Series” (plain black text) sits flush under the lowest box.   2. Directly above, a lavender-grey rounded rectangle labelled “Normalization”.   3. From the top-centre of “Normalization”, draw a solid vertical black arrow upward into a tall rounded rectangle container (light-blue fill, thin blue outline the same color as fill but 50 % darker).      a. Inside this container, stack three internal modules with 4-pixel spacing:       i. Bottom: a skinny horizontal pill labelled “Patching”; inside are eight equally-spaced miniature vertical bars, each 9 px tall and 3 px wide, filled with very light steel blue; bars sit on an invisible baseline.        ii. Middle: a full-width rectangle “Vector Quantization” (light yellow-green).       iii. Top: a full-width rectangle “Projection” (dusty pink).   4. From the top-centre of that large container, draw a solid arrow upward into a teal rectangle labelled “Decoder”.   5. From the top-centre of “Decoder”, another arrow points up into a lavender-grey rectangle labelled “De-normalization”.   6. From the top-centre of “De-normalization”, a final arrow goes up and terminates at the word “Prediction” (plain black text; no surrounding box).   7. Normalization statistics shortcut: from the right side of “Normalization”, draw an L-shaped black arrow that travels up the outside of the pipeline’s left edge, hugging it, until it meets the left side of “De-normalization”. At the bend (just right of the large blue container), place the inline label “µₓ, σₓ” in italic black text.  RIGHT-HAND PIPELINE (Proposed method) 1. Mirroring the left layout but using updated modules:       a. Bottom annotation “Input Series”.      b. Lavender-grey “Normalization” rectangle.      c. Upward arrow into a teal “Encoder” rectangle (same width as normalization).      d. Upward arrow into a taller rounded-corner outer container (light warm-grey fill, dark-grey outline).  Inside it are two stacked internal modules with 4-pixel gap:       • Bottom: pale-yellow rectangle “Sparse Vector Quantization”.         • Top: deep-teal rectangle “Transformer”.      e. Upward arrow to lavender-grey “De-normalization”.      f. Upward arrow to “Prediction” text.   2. Statistics shortcut identical to the left: L-shaped arrow running up the left edge of the right pipeline, labelled “µₓ, σₓ”.  CALLOUT BOXES (drawn with grey 2-pixel dashed outlines, rounded corners, light-grey background transparency 10 %) • Two callouts float on the right side of the right pipeline, connected via grey dashed leader lines (thin, 1.5-pixel).     1. LOWER CALLOUT (aligned vertically with the “Encoder”–“Sparse Vector Quantization” junction):        – Contains a mini-diagram of the patching + projection pair stacked vertically inside the dashed frame.        – Bottom element: mini “Patching” graphic identical in style to earlier (tiny vertical bars).        – 4-pixel gap then a pink rectangle “Projection”.        – A solid upward arrow links “Patching” to “Projection”.     2. UPPER CALLOUT (aligned with the “Transformer” box):        – Bottom rectangle: light yellow-green “Multi-Head Attention”.        – Solid upward arrow into top rectangle: pale yellow “Add & Norm”.        – A dotted black feedback arrow (1-pixel dash) loops from the right edge of “Add & Norm” back down to the right edge of “Multi-Head Attention”, forming a clockwise curved feedback.    ARROWS AND SPACING • All primary flow arrows are solid black, 2 px stroke, arrow-head length 8 px.   • Vertical spacing between stacked pipeline boxes: exactly the height of the arrow-head (makes arrows look attached).   • All modules in the left and right pipelines are horizontally centered under each other; the two pipelines themselves are horizontally symmetric relative to the middle dashed divider.  DIVIDER • A vertical dashed line (black, 3 px stroke, 8 px dash, 8 px gap) spans full canvas height, positioned exactly halfway across the width.  OPTIONAL EMBELLISHMENTS • Very subtle drop shadow (1 px offset, 10 % opacity) on every primary box for depth.   • Provide equal left and right outer margins (~5 % canvas width) so nothing touches the edge.  The final image should clearly communicate two parallel model architectures, using the exact labels, colors, shapes, callouts, arrows and relative placements described above."

CENTER PANEL (one detailed ST-Conv block, blue frame)   Geometry   • Center panel width ≈ 35 % of canvas.   • A large sky-blue outer rectangle (fill #C7E1F3) represents the block; stroke 2 pt.   • Inside, three smaller horizontal bars stacked with 4 mm gaps; centered full width (except small rightward skip arrow).    Internal elements (top→bottom)   1. Top bar (salmon fill #F5B49E):      text “Temporal Gated-Conv, C=64”.   2. Middle bar (pale yellow fill #FAE6A4):      text “Spatial Graph-Conv, C=16”.   3. Bottom bar (same salmon fill):      text identical to top bar.    Arrows / connections inside block   • A thick vertical arrow goes straight down the middle, entering from the top of the outer rectangle, passing through the centers of the three inner bars, and exiting the bottom as output.   • On the right side of the middle (yellow) bar draw a 90° elbow arrow: it exits the bar’s right edge, turns upward, runs along the inside of the outer rectangle’s right border to the top, then exits the blue outer rectangle to the right, terminating at the division bar.     Label this arrow head with small italic “W” (9 pt) placed just left of the bar.    Input / output labels   • Above the blue frame put “V^{l}” (superscript l) in italic, centered.   • Below the frame, under the downward arrow tip, put “V^{l+1}”.    RIGHT PANEL (temporal gated-conv internals)   Geometry   • Right panel width ≈ 30 % of canvas.   • Outer rectangle: warm light-peach fill #F4C5A8.   • Inside, two internal blocks:      – top-right: small white square (fill #FFFFFF) labelled “1-D Conv”.      – bottom-left: small orange rectangle (fill #F0B174) labelled “GLU”.   • The white square is approx. 30 mm wide, 20 mm tall; the orange GLU block 28 mm wide, 14 mm tall.    Internal arrows   • A bold vertical arrow enters from the top center of the peach frame, hugging the left interior wall, proceeds straight down to the GLU block.   • From the right edge of the GLU block, a short arrow heads right, then turns upward (90°) to the white “1-D Conv” block, forming a gate loop.     Along the horizontal segment place the label “Temporal Gated-Conv” (10 pt) slightly above the line.   • From the bottom center of the GLU block a downward arrow exits the peach frame. Beneath it write “(V^{l}_{t-M+K}, … , V^{l}_{t})”.    Input label   • Above the top entry arrow of the peach frame write “(V^{l}_{t-M+1}, … , V^{l}_{t})”.    Color codes summary   • Cyan ST-Conv block: #B6D3E4   • Green Output Layer: #B9D9A6   • Blue outer ST-Conv frame: #C7E1F3   • Salmon Temporal blocks: #F5B49E   • Yellow Spatial block: #FAE6A4   • Peach outer temporal block: #F4C5A8   • Orange GLU: #F0B174   • White inner conv: #FFFFFF    Stylistic notes   • Use uniform stroke widths except where noted; avoid gradients or shadows.   • Align all text perfectly centered within its rectangle.   • Maintain equal margins (10 mm) around panels inside the canvas.   • Produce a crisp vector (SVG or PDF) so lines remain sharp when zoomed."
t2i_image_caption_135="Ultra-detailed image generation prompt (English) – reproduce the diagram exactly, suitable for a scientific journal:  “Create a clean, flat-vector, landscape-oriented flow-chart with an aspect ratio of roughly 3 : 1 (≈2048 × 650 px). Use thin (≈2 px) pure-black #000000 outlines around every box and arrow. All arrows have filled triangular heads. Solid arrows indicate ‘Training & Execution’, dashed arrows indicate ‘Only Training’. Font everywhere is Times New Roman, bold, pure black, identical point size except where noted. All boxes have a very light pastel fill, no gradients. Overall background is white.  1. Legend (top-left corner):    • A horizontal white rectangular legend box, outline #000000, sized about 20 % of total width, 17 % of height.      • Inside, on the left, draw a solid black arrow (thick 4 px shaft, 40 px long) pointing right. To its right place the text ‘Training & Execution’.      • Beneath this arrow, draw a black dashed arrow (same size, dash pattern 12-px dash 8-px gap) pointing right, label to its right ‘Only Training’.      • All legend text left-aligned with arrows.  2. Central left “Environment” block:    • Large pastel-peach rectangle (#F7DCC9) bordered black, occupying about 30 % width and 70 % height, vertically centred.      • Bottom-left inside corner put the label ‘Environment’ in small italics.      • Inside, down the left side, stack L reddish sub-blocks (show 3 explicitly and ellipsis):           ‑ Each sub-block is a rounded rectangle (#D9A4A4), identical size, label centred: ‘RIS 1’, ‘RIS 2’, middle ellipsis ‘…’, and lower ‘RIS L’.           ‑ Stack is vertically centred.      • On middle-right inside edge of Environment block place a violet-grey (#CFC6D3) rounded rectangle labeled ‘BS’. Align its vertical centre with the mid-point between RIS 2 and RIS … . Text ‘BS’ centred.      • To the right of RIS stack, left-aligned text ‘Scheduling Action’ near top-right inside edge pointing to where an arrow ﬁres out.      • Under BS put the text ‘BS Precoding Action’ left-aligned. Both phrases use same bold font.  3. Arrows emanating from Environment:    • From the top of Environment, a solid horizontal arrow exits right, labelled above its shaft ‘RIS Action’.      • From the mid-right edge (aligned with the word ‘Scheduling Action’) a solid arrow goes right into the ‘Scheduling Actor’ box.      • From the BS rectangle’s right edge a solid arrow exits into the ‘BS Precoding Actor’ box.      • From the bottom-edge centre of Environment a solid arrow goes downward into ‘Channel Estimation’.  4. Channel Estimation:    • A small light-cream rectangle (#FFF3C7), black border, centred directly under Environment, spaced with small gap. Label centred ‘Channel Estimation’.  5. Big right-hand “Policy / Parameter Sharing” block:    • Pastel-vanilla rectangle (#F8E8B4) bordered black, same height as Environment, occupies ≈30 % width, placed so its left border is aligned with arrow ends coming from Environment.      • Along its bottom edge, centred left, put the text ‘Policy’; centred right put the text ‘Parameter Sharing’.      • Inside, top-left quarter, a violet-grey (#CFC6D3) rounded rectangle labelled ‘Scheduling Actor’.      • Beneath it, same width, another violet-grey rounded rectangle labelled ‘BS Precoding Actor’.      • Right half of block: vertically stack L reddish (#D9A4A4) rounded rectangles labelled ‘RIS Actor 1’, ‘RIS Actor 2’, middle ellipsis bullet ‘·’, and bottom ‘RIS Actor L’. Keep equal spacing.  6. Arrows inside right block:    • No arrows inside; only the three incoming arrows described above enter their respective actor boxes.  7. Outgoing arrows from right block to training modules:    • From the right edge (mid-height of RIS Actor stack) draw a black dashed arrow pointing right into ‘Replay Buffer’. Label just to left of arrow ‘Actor Loss’.      • From the bottom-edge centre of right block draw a black dashed arrow downward into ‘Centralized Critic’. Label beside the shaft ‘Critic Loss’.  8. Centralized Critic:    • Gold rectangle (#FFC72C), black border, moderate size, centred horizontally between Channel Estimation and Adam Optimizer, near image bottom. Label centred ‘Centralized Critic’.  9. Replay Buffer and Adam Optimizer (rightmost column):    • Top right: light pastel-blue rectangle (#BFD4FF) labeled ‘Replay Buffer’.      • Directly beneath it, same width, light pastel-green rectangle (#BCE6B3) labeled ‘Adam Optimizer’.      • Black dashed arrow from Replay Buffer bottom to Adam Optimizer top (vertical).      • Black dashed arrow from Adam Optimizer left edge to base of the dashed arrow that carries ‘Critic Loss’, labelled on the arrow ‘Reward’.  10. Dashed feedback from Centralized Critic:    • From Centralized Critic top-right corner draw a dashed arrow angling up to connect to the dashed vertical arrow feeding Adam Optimizer (meeting at mid-point). No separate label (already labelled ‘Critic Loss’ earlier).  11. Line and alignment notes:    • All boxes horizontally flush on two main vertical axes (Environment/Channel Estimation/Centralized Critic on left axis; Policy block/Centralized Critic/Adam on right axis; Replay Buffer directly above Adam).      • Use consistent 20 px corner radius for rounded rectangles. Ellipses use a centred baseline dot ‘…’ or ‘·’ exactly as in source.      • Ensure arrows never overlap text; leave comfortable white margins.  Render the diagram in crisp vector style, no pixelation, journal-quality.”"

From the neural-network icon, draw a right-pointing arrow labeled ‘Inference’ into a rounded rectangle (light-blue fill, black border, 155 px × 40 px) reading ‘Synthetic Rationales’.   7. From that rectangle, draw a curved upward arrow (clockwise) back toward the fountain-pen icon; label this arrow ‘Feedback’ and place another identical fountain-pen icon midway on it.   8. From the right edge of ‘Synthetic Rationales’, draw a right-pointing arrow into a medium-grey rounded rectangle (150 px × 40 px) labeled ‘Critic Data’.  Below that rectangle, a downward dashed arrow labeled ‘SFT’ flows into sub-panel (b).    C. Sub-panel (b): “Critic Model” evaluation (lower half).   1. Inside the dashed border, stack three evaluation blocks separated by 10 px:       Block 1 – Retrieval Quality      • Header strip: pastel light-green (100 % width, 32 px tall), bold black text ‘Retrieval Quality’.      • Content box beneath header: white background, thin black border, 100 % width, 60 px tall.  Inside, typeset:        ‘Q: Where was the film ‘The Family Stone’ set?’ (line break)        ‘D: The Family Stone. The Stone family is a …’      • At the far right of this block, three vertically stacked legend boxes (42 px × 18 px each, 4 px gap):        Top – mint-green fill, black outline, text ‘Relevant’;        Middle – peach-orange fill, label ‘Partial’;        Bottom – salmon-red fill, label ‘Irrelevant’.      An arrow (medium-grey) from the content box points toward this legend stack.       Block 2 – Reasoning Quality (same geometry, 10 px under Block 1)      • Header strip: pastel light-blue-green, text ‘Reasoning Quality’.      • Identical Q/D text inside.      • Legend stack right-aligned: top teal-blue ‘Useful’, middle peach-orange ‘Partial’, bottom salmon-red ‘Useless’.      Arrow points from content to legend.       Block 3 – Overall Quality (10 px under Block 2)      • Header strip: pastel light-green, text ‘Overall Quality’.      • White content area (no legend) containing single line: ‘Evaluate the whole reasoning trajectory.’    2. Bottom-center of sub-panel: a horizontal 5-cell Likert scale (each cell 32 px × 32 px, 4 px gap).  Cells are numbered ‘1 2 3 4 5’, left-to-right.  Gradient fill: #e45b5b (red) through #e6a15b (orange) to #9bd47e (green).  Black thin borders around each cell.    3. Bottom-right corner: a small critic-model avatar—cartoon bust with navy shirt, pale skin, question-mark thought bubble above the head.    D. Arrow connections between panels   • From the ‘Critic Data’ rectangle in panel (a), draw a thick vertical grey arrow descending into the left side of sub-panel (b).   • From the bottom of sub-panel (b), draw a curved arrow looping back up (clockwise, hugging right margin) toward the neural-network icon in panel (a), labeled ‘Critic Model’.    E. Color palette   • Title text: #000000   • Dashed borders: #a0a0a0   • Light pastel fills:     – Blue bars #d7e3f8     – Light-green headers #e8f4e4     – Light-blue-green header #d9ecf0   • Legend fills: mint-green #a2dca1, peach-orange #f1c19a, salmon-red #e68787, teal-blue #82c0d9   • Likert scale gradient: left #e45b5b, then #e89b5b, #e3c65b, #c2d85b, right #9bd47e.    Ensure all text is crisp and readable; arrows have arrowheads, 2 px stroke; rounded rectangles have 4 px corner radius unless specified.”"

Overall aspect ratio ≈ 1.2:1 (width ≈ 900 px, height ≈ 750 px).  Use a white page background and crisp black borders around every major shape.  All text is in bold, black, sans-serif font (≈ 18 pt for component labels, ≈ 22 pt for panel titles).  Arrow heads are filled, arrow shafts are 3 px thick.  Color palette is soft/pastel.  Details panel-by-panel from top to bottom:   1.  Top panel title (left-aligned, above border): ‘Prompt Tuning (Discrete)’.      A light blue dashed rounded rectangle (stroke 3 px, dash 6-3 pattern) sits at panel left, width ≈ 30 % of panel, height ≈ 50 % of panel height.  Inside, two side-by-side regular rectangles:       • Left rectangle (label ‘Multimodal Tokens’)  – pastel cornflower-blue fill.       • Right rectangle (label ‘Textual Input’)      – pastel cyan fill.    Under these two rectangles, four narrow horizontal tiles (height 25 % of the dashed box, evenly spaced) colored light pastel green form the “Discrete Prompt” bar.  A thick upward curved arrow (golden-yellow, 3 px) originates from the prompt tiles’ center and points toward the gap between the two upper rectangles.  Text ‘Discrete Prompt’ in green italics sits just above this arrow.     To the immediate right of the dashed box, a short royal-blue right-pointing arrow (label-less) connects to a large rounded rectangle labeled ‘LLM’.  The LLM rectangle is filled solid pastel cyan, outlined black 3 px, width ≈ 22 %, height ≈ 60 % of panel.  A medium-sized icy-blue snow-flake icon is drawn in its upper-right corner.     From the right edge of the LLM, another royal-blue arrow leads to a medium rectangle ‘Output’ (pastel green fill).  A thin black arrow points from ‘Output’ to a tall grey rectangle ‘Loss’.  Finally, a long L-shaped orange feedback arrow (3 px) starts at ‘Loss’, bends downward then leftward, and touches the bottom border of the LLM rectangle.  Small orange text ‘tune’ sits near this arrow’s end.   2.  Middle panel title: ‘Prompt Tuning (Continuous)’.      Repeat overall layout but modify colors/contents:     • Dashed blue box identical size.  Inside: same two upper rectangles (Multimodal Tokens / Textual Input) with same colors.      • Beneath them, a single continuous prompt bar: seven equal rectangular segments tiled horizontally, full width, pale vanilla-yellow fill.  Down-to-up straight arrow (golden-yellow, 3 px) rises from the prompt bar’s center to the gap above.  Text ‘Continuous Prompt’ in matching yellow just above arrow.     • LLM rectangle is split horizontally 50:50: top half pastel cyan, bottom half pastel peach.  The division is crisp straight line.  A snow-flake icon remains in top-right; a small orange-red flame icon is located in bottom-right corner.  (Icons identical style to top panel.)     • Output rectangle is pastel vanilla-yellow.  Other arrows identical.  The tuning arrow touches the bottom rim of the LLM (orange text ‘tune’ in same place).   3.  Bottom panel title: ‘Instruction Tuning’.      Left dashed box identical size and position.  Inside: two upper rectangles as before.      Under them, two equal-width light pink rectangles labelled implicitly as instructions.  A straight upward arrow colored magenta (#d4006d) arises from their center toward the gap.  Text ‘Instruction’ in vivid magenta italic sits just above arrow.     LLM rectangle: full fill very light beige (single color), black outline; only a small orange-red flame icon in bottom-right (no snow-flake).       Output rectangle pastel pink.  Other arrows (blue flow, black to ‘Loss’, orange tuning) same style.  Global details: • Panels separated by 4 px thick black horizontal lines. • All internal rectangles have 3 px black outline except dashed boxes (blue). • Components are horizontally centered in each panel with equal gutter spacing. • Maintain consistent vertical alignment of flow arrows across panels.  Result: a neat, high-resolution illustration suitable for inclusion in a machine-learning research paper.”"

RIGHT PANEL (surrounded by navy-blue dashed rounded border, width ≈ 1050 px)   • The border starts just above mid-height of the left “Zero-init” box and encloses everything to the right.    2. Bottom row inside right panel — KEY–VALUE INPUTS      • Three horizontally aligned rectangular blocks, each 75 px tall:        – Leftmost:  Q  (square pastel-blue 100 × 75 px).        – Next:      k₁ pastel-peach 60 × 75 px, then k₂ pastel-peach 60 × 75 px, then K_vanilla pastel-blue 140 × 75 px (these three adjacent with 1-px black gaps).        – On same y-line but to the right:  v₁, v₂ (peach) and V_vanilla (blue) mirror the K blocks (same sizes).      • Directly under the row, italic grey equation:        “Q ∈ ℝ^{K×C}   K, V ∈ ℝ^{(K+H+(M−H))×C}”.    3. SOFTMAX ATTENTION MODULE (mid-height)      • Above the K blocks, a white rounded rectangle outlined navy (500 × 130 px).      • Inside, centred black equation “softmax( Q Kᵀ / √dₖ )”.      • A thick upward navy arrow leads into this box from the Q block.      • Two thick navy arrows emerge from left and right edges of the K blocks into the box.    4. COMBINED SCORE TENSOR (top-left of right panel)      • Directly above the softmax box: another dotted navy envelope containing three vertical sub-blocks concatenated:        – S_vanilla (left) pastel-blue width 120 px, height 120 px; under it label “K” with horizontal grey arrow of same width.        – S₂ (middle) pastel-peach width 70 px.        – S₁ (right) pastel-peach width 70 px.      • Over the whole concatenated bar a light-grey double-headed arrow labelled “K+(M−H)+H”.      • From below, a thick blue vertical arrow connects the softmax box to the S_vanilla portion.      • From the right side of S₁ a black horizontal connector leads to the next stage.      • Onto that connector sits an orange circle ⊗ (same style as before) with “gating” arrow entering from left (orange).    5. GATED REPRESENTATION & CAUSAL LOSS NODE      • Where the black horizontal line passes the ⊗, it continues to a dashed black circle (Ø 60 px) labelled X_G (italic, centre).      • Above this circle, a small red hammer icon (symbolizing intervention) hits the circumference.      • Next to hammer, curved black text “L_causal”.    6. OUTPUT TO NEXT LAYER      • From X_G circle, the black line continues rightward 50 px, then turns upward 90°, becoming a vertical thick black arrow up to a row of 6 adjacent small green rectangles (vector Z) forming a strip 270 × 45 px.      • From Z, a dashed black upward arrow (25 px) exits the border, labelled faint grey “Next layer”.    7.

t2i_image_caption_155="An ultra-high-resolution scientific diagram (vector style, 5200 × 1500 px, RGB, thin crisp lines, Arial/Helvetica text, 100 % white background).   The whole figure is a left-to-right pipeline that contains three macro blocks: (1) a light-cyan “Relation Module” on the far left, (2) a centre stack of alternating blue “Cognition Layer” and purple “Perception Layer”, and (3) a zoom-in view of the Perception Layer architecture drawn inside a pale-lavender dashed frame on the far right.   All arrows are solid black (2 px), all bounding frames use black dashed lines (6 px dash, 3 px gap), rounded-corner rectangles have 8 px corner radius. Text inside modules is 26 pt bold, labels on arrows are 22 pt italic, labels beside tiny dashed boxes are 20 pt bold italic.       1) Leftmost “Relation Module” (x = 50, y = 200, w = 900, h ≈ 450)   • Outer frame: dashed rectangle; inside fill #DDF5FF (5 % cyan).   Inside, two horizontally-elongated rounded rectangles stacked vertically (vertical gap 50 px):    a) Bottom rectangle (x = 100, y ≈ 420, w = 600, h = 70, fill #F79A9C).        Centred label: “Ins.-Ins. Relation”.        Inputs:          – From the absolute left edge (x = 0, y aligned to rectangle centre) comes a right-pointing arrow labelled “fₘ”.          – Beneath its bottom-edge centre, a tiny dashed rectangle (w = 150, h = 30, no fill) that encloses three little pink squares (20 × 20 px) represents query tokens.  Label “Qₚ” sits 15 px above this box, left aligned.  A short 35 px vertical arrow goes up from the tiny box into the bottom module.          – Right-bottom corner: a small icon of three overlapping black instance silhouettes (little “people” masks), size 60 × 35 px.  A 25 px upward arrow from this icon touches the module’s bottom-right edge.  Icon is labelled “Mₚ” beneath.       Output: From the top-edge centre, a 30 px vertical arrow goes up, turns right 90 °, travels 200 px, is labelled “Q′ₚ”, and enters the module above.    b) Top rectangle (x = 100, y ≈ 300, w = 600, h = 70, fill #B7EBC4).        Centred label: “Ins.-Text Relation”.        Inputs:          – From left margin, arrow labelled “fₜ”.          – The “Q′ₚ” arrow (from the module below) enters its bottom edge.        Output:          – From top edge, 50 px vertical arrow enters a tiny dashed rectangle identical to the one used for Qₚ but coloured light salmon; label “Q_c” above it.          – From right edge, a 120 px arrow leads into a small light-grey rounded rectangle (w = 130, h = 55, fill #D8D8D8) labelled “MLP”.          – From the top of the MLP, a 110 px vertical arrow escapes the outer cyan frame; the arrow is labelled “Sᵣ”.    Outer-frame outputs: three identical black-dashed lines (2 px) extend from the right border of the cyan frame toward the centre block.  They are vertically aligned with Cognition Layer 1, Layer 2, and Layer k and are captioned “Sᵣ₁”, “Sᵣ₂”, “Sᵣₖ” respectively (names placed above each dashed line).     2) Central stack (x ≈ 1150) – three “Cognition Layer” / “Perception Layer” pairs, vertically aligned.  Per-level geometry (topmost = k, mid = 2, bottom = 1):     • Cognition Layer: rounded rectangle, w = 500, h = 70, fill #8CB7E5, separated vertically by 60 px.  Inside text: “Cognition Layer”.       Inputs on the left edge: two parallel arrows; upper one is labelled “fₜ”, lower one “fₘ”.  Each arrow length 160 px, they split from the common lines coming out of the cyan block.        Output: from right edge a straight arrow (170 px) labelled “Qₚ₍ₖ/₂/₁₎” enters a tiny pink dashed rectangle (w = 150, h = 30, containing three small pink squares).  These dashed rectangles sit flush against the Cognition Layer’s right edge.        Special for layer 1 (bottom): the arrow continues through a small 30 px-diameter white circle with black outline placed 90 px to the right of the Cognition Layer.  The circle is labelled “C1”.  The line continues past the circle into the tiny dashed Qₚ₁ box.  The segment between circle and box is still labelled “Q_c₁”.      • Perception Layer: right of each Qₚ dashed box, a lavender rounded rectangle (w = 600, h = 70, fill #C7AFE8), text “Perception Layer”.       Additional input: an upward-pointing arrow (70 px) labelled “fₕ” strikes the bottom edge centre of every Perception Layer.       Output: from right edge an arrow (labelled “Mₚ₁ / Mₚ₂ / Mₚₖ”) exits 160 px, then turns up slightly as dashed slanted lines pointing to the rightmost zoom-in frame, indicating these outputs share the same internal structure.     3) Rightmost “Perception Layer (Zoom-in)” (x = 3500, y ≈ 200, w ≈ 700, h ≈ 450)  • Outer dashed rectangle, stroke same as earlier, fill #F7F2FF (4 % lavender).    Inside, two stacked rounded rectangles (30 px vertical gap):     a) Bottom rectangle (w = 500, h = 65, fill #C4C4C4), text “Cross Attention”.     b) Top rectangle   (w = 500, h = 65, fill #DBDBDB), text “Self Attention”.  Internal flow:     • Left-hand inputs to “Cross Attention”:          – A tiny dashed rectangle (w = 150, h = 30, no fill, label “Qᵢ” below) with three small pink squares sits 90 px left of the outer frame; a short arrow enters the left edge of Cross Attention.          – Directly beneath Qᵢ box is a tiny lavender icon showing three successively thicker vertical feature maps; label “fₕ₁–₃” under it.  Arrow enters left edge of Cross Attention immediately below the Qᵢ arrow.      • Output of Cross Attention: straight 60 px arrow upward into Self Attention.    • Extra input to Self Attention: from just above the top-left corner of Self Attention another tiny dashed rectangle identical to Qₚ boxes, label “Qₚ′”; a 35 px arrow goes down into Self Attention.    • Output of Self Attention: arrow (120 px) exits right and enters a 42 px-diameter circle containing the multiplication sign “⊗” (black symbol on white fill).          – A tiny dashed rectangle showing the instance-mask stack (label “Mₚ”) sits above this circle; a short downward arrow joins the circle from that mask icon, indicating gating.          – From the right side of ⊗ circle, a 140 px arrow leads to label “Mₚ” (final mask).    • Additional visual-feature pathway:          – On the absolute right of the lavender frame, a tall lavender feature-map slab (55 × 110 px) labelled “fₕ₄” sends a left-pointing arrow into a 36 px-diameter circle labelled “C2” (white fill, black ring).          – From below C2, a vertical arrow labelled “fᵥ” goes down (indicating fusion).          – From the left side of C2, a short arrow penetrates the right border of the lavender frame, pointing into the Self Attention rectangle.    • From the bottom border of the lavender frame, a long black arrow (labelled “fₘ”) returns leftwards toward the centre, showing feedback into earlier modules.     Styling details:   • Font colour pure black.   • All arrows start/finish with triangular solid heads.   • Corner radii and colours are consistent across repeated elements.   • All tiny dashed token boxes contain three evenly spaced 20 × 20 px filled salmon squares to visually depict token slots.   • Vertical alignment between Cognition/Perception pairs is precise; horizontal distances: 160 px between any module and its next neighbour.   • Every label uses subscripts exactly as written (Qₚ, fₕ₁–₃, Sᵣ, etc.).   • No drop shadows, no gradients – entirely flat vector aesthetic.  The final image must look identical in structure and colour coding to the provided reference figure, with pixel-perfect positioning of every module, arrow, icon, label, dashed outline, and colour."

Right-bottom icon: yellow page with green shield-check (only one icon if space tight; otherwise place both side by side).  D. Small details   • Keep all text pure black except the light-gray italic ‘Iterative Search’.   • All dashed frames have inner 10 px padding so lines never touch internal blocks.   • Shadows: none (flat style).   • Ensure overall balance—top and bottom tiers are the same width; pipeline elements are horizontally centered relative to the lower capability boxes.  The resulting figure must look identical in layout, proportions, colors, and annotations to a polished scientific-paper illustration.”"

Square size ≈25 px, gap ≈6 px.   • Masked (missing) tokens: two of these squares are replaced by black “X” marks drawn over empty space beneath the row to emphasize missing tokens; those X marks sit at the same horizontal positions as the missing grey squares.   • Module blocks are isosceles trapezoids/houseshapes: wide top, narrower bottom, light pastel fills, thick black borders, centered under the token row.   • Arrows: solid black, medium thickness, arrow-heads filled black, pointing strictly vertical unless specified otherwise.   • Colored latent tokens: a horizontal chain of seven rounded squares (same size as grey tokens) directly underneath the arrow(s). Colors, from left to right, are: dark-maroon (#6c1d12), brick-red (#b73225), crimson (#e2574d), two hatch-pattern squares (45° diagonal black lines over white), ochre-yellow (#dca940), pale-orange (#f1c15b).    Subfigure (a) – “Random mask token”   1. Title text above everything, left-aligned: “(a) Random mask token”.   2. Under the 8 grey input squares, two “X” symbols (large, thick strokes) replace squares #3 and #6.   3. Immediately below the input row sits a single, wide, lavender (#c6b4ec) trapezoid labelled, centered in two lines:      line1: “Mamba”      line2: “Encoder”   4. A single solid black vertical arrow points upward from the center of the colored latent-token row to a light-grey trapezoid labeled “Image Decoder”. Its shape is an upside-down trapezoid (wide bottom, narrower top).   5. Directly beneath that arrow, the 7 colored latent-tokens form the horizontal chain described earlier.   6. Under the colored tokens (still inside same subfigure) a label “Mask Token” is placed slightly above the arrow, following its path.    Subfigure (b) – “Selective Structure State Space Sequence Token-interpolation (TOKI)”   1. Title text centered above the right block, broken into two stacked lines:      top line: “(b) Selective Structure State Space”      second line: “Sequence Token-interpolation (TOKI)”   2. Layout is visually split into TWO parallel pipelines (left half and right half) under the common title, but enclosed inside one dashed rounded-rectangle (stroke black 2 px, dash pattern 8 px/4 px, corner radius 8 px) that surrounds only the latent token row of this subfigure.   3. Beneath the shared 8 grey input squares (with same two “X” marks below as in subfigure a) are TWO stacked encoder blocks forming a “Hybrid Encoder”:      • Bottom trapezoid: light-cream (#f6eac6) labeled “Sparse Conv”.      • Above it: lavender (#c6b4ec) trapezoid labeled “Mamba”.   4. One vertical black arrow rises from the hybrid encoder stack to the latent-token dashed area.   5. Inside the dashed rounded rectangle, reuse the exact 7 colored latent-token squares, arranged left-to-right identical to subfigure (a).   6. Between every adjacent pair of colored tokens draw curved dashed orange arrows (stroke #f8a14a) pointing rightwards, representing “Token-interpolation”; the arrows arc slightly upward.   7. Above the dashed rectangle, centered, a smaller text label: “Token-interpolation”.   8. From the dashed rectangle, TWO separate solid black vertical arrows rise upward to TWO identical upside-down light-grey trapezoids labeled “Image Decoder”, one arrow under the left half, one under the right half, depicting that the same token stream feeds two decoders. The two decoder blocks sit at the same vertical level, evenly spaced horizontally.   9. To the extreme right of the hybrid encoder stack, aligned vertically midway, add a small text label “Hybrid Encoder” rotated 90° clockwise, outside the main shapes.    Stylistic instructions   • Maintain equal horizontal spacing between subfigure (a) and (b), with a small vertical dotted guide line (not rendered) indicating visual separation.   • Use consistent stroke width for all outlines and text.   • Ensure alignment: token rows, decoders, and encoders form crisp vertical stacks.   • All fills are flat, no gradients.   • Figure overall width ~1200 px, height ~650 px.   • Provide clear negative space, no crowding.    The output should look identical in layout, colors, text, and labeling to the reference schematic described above.”"
t2i_image_caption_163="Recreating the diagram in a vector-style, publication-ready quality (all coordinates and sizes are relative so the whole illustration can scale; color names refer to standard web/print CMYK/RGB tones):  1. Canvas & Global Layout • Create a horizontal rectangular canvas with ~3:1 aspect ratio (width about 3× height).   • Divide it into five vertical regions, separated by thin 1 pt mid-gray (#999999) borders:     (a) left narrow “Input Image” column     (b) slim “Patch Embed” column     (c) large central “HgVT Block ×L” rounded-corner box     (d) slim “Pooling” column     (e) narrow right-most “Output Head” column.   • Leave a 25 px white margin around the entire canvas.  2. Region-by-Region Details  A. Input Image Column (far left, width 17 % of canvas) • Draw a square photo patch (~80 % of column width) showing a green grassy background and a horizontally placed fish with golden scales and a dark lateral line. Overlay a 3 × 3 white grid (2 pt lines) that splits the photo into nine equal squares.   • Place a bold black caption “Input Image” flush left beneath the photo. Use 11  pt Arial.  B.

Attn.”        – To the right of #2, aligned top, same size and style as #2, same lavender fill.    5. “Vertex FFN”        – To the right of #4, same width as #1, pale orange (#ffdfb2) fill, burnt-orange border.    6. “Adj. Mask”        – Square block tucked below #1, same height as #3, pale mint (#dff8df) fill, green border.  • Arrow System (use 3 pt arrows, arrowheads 6 px, colors reference legend below):     – Orange arrows: represent X_adj^(V). Start from the dotted orange input column, curve up to #1, exit top of #1, snake above all modules, and finally feed into #5.     – Red arrows: X^(V). Originate from the red input squares, flow into #1, out of #1 into #2, continue out of #2 into #4, then into #5.     – Dark-blue arrows: X^(E). Start from navy input squares, go into bottom of #6, route right into bottom of #3, then upward into #4, exit #4 right into Pooling column.     – Light-blue arrows: X_adj^(E). Begin at teal input squares, flow via left side into #6, out of #6 into bottom-left of #2, down to #3, then forward to #4 and out.     – Green arrows: A (adjacency). From lime-green input squares, arc into bottom of #6, then directly up into #2, and also up into #4.     – All arrows labelled “Flow” in 8 pt italic gray near mid-section (two instances, pointing downward near #3 and #4).  D. Pooling Column (4th, width 8 %, same light-gray fill as block background, 2 pt dark-gray outline) • Title “Pooling” on top, bold 11 pt Arial.   • Stack three equal rectangles with 6 px gaps:     1. Top: pale rose (#ffd5d5) fill, red border, caption “Mean Image”.     2. Middle: very light sky-blue (#d8ecff) fill, blue border, caption “Mean Edge”.     3.

Output Head Column (rightmost, width 6 %) • Draw a tall narrow rounded rectangle, horizontal orientation (i.e., rotated 90°) with burnt-orange (#ff9b4b) fill and 2 pt darker-orange border.   • Put bold white text “Output Head”, 11 pt Arial, rotated 90° clockwise.   • Place a black triangular arrowhead connecting Pooling column to this block.  F. Legend Box (bottom-right corner, width 14 %, height ~28 %) • Title “Legend” in bold black, 10 pt Arial, left-aligned.   • Underneath, list five rows, each with a 28 px horizontal colored line sample (3 pt thick) followed by black label:     – Orange line, text “X_adj^(V)” (superscripted V).     – Red line, text “X^(V)”.     – Dark-blue line, text “X^(E)”.     – Light-blue line, text “X_adj^(E)”.     – Green line, text “A”.   • Use consistent small-cap superscripts; labels in 9 pt Arial; keep ~4 px vertical spacing.  3. Typography & Styling • All module titles: bold 10 pt Arial, black.   • All interior labels (“Flow”, bracket labels, legend text) 8–9 pt Arial, black except “Flow” which is 70 % gray.   • Arrows use rounded ends, solid fill.   • Module borders are slightly darker than fills (20 % darker).   • Rounded rectangle corner radii: small boxes 3 px, large boxes 4 px.    4. Balance & Alignment • Keep vertical centers of main modules aligned.   • Ensure dotted input stacks line up precisely with the left edge of the HgVT block so that arrows emerge smoothly.   • Maintain uniform 10 px padding inside every rounded rectangle.    5. Export Guidance • Output as vector-based PDF/SVG for print, 300 dpi if rasterized, CMYK safe palette."
t2i_image_caption_164="Recreating the figure:  “Create a high-resolution, vector-style schematic (landscape orientation, roughly 3:1 width-to-height ratio) that explains an AI-image-detection pipeline. Use a crisp, modern flat-design aesthetic with rounded corners and dashed outlines. The layout is divided into three main vertical sections arranged left-to-right, each enclosed by its own dashed rectangle: purple on the far left, green in the middle, blue on the right. An additional thin yellow dashed rectangle is horizontally attached under the blue section for final equations.  SECTION 1  (purple dashed border): • In the top-left corner, draw a small circular avatar icon of a friendly blue chatbot wearing a headset, on a white background. • To the right of the avatar, place the label “Input <image>” in bold black sans-serif font (≈24 pt), center-aligned. Directly under this label, embed a square thumbnail (≈90 × 90 px) of a colorful photograph of a child sitting cross-legged in front of a hand-painted rainbow arch on a white wall. (Face is not described.) • Under the thumbnail, inside a lavender rounded rectangle that fills most of section 1, add the following question text in large playful black handwriting-style font (≈26 pt, slightly tilted baseline for informal feel):    “Is this a real image,      a partially AI-edited image,      or a fully AI-generated image?      Just answer with A / B.”    Break the four lines exactly as above; center them and keep generous line spacing. • At the bottom of this lavender box, place two wide buttons side-by-side:    1. Left button: pastel-green background, rounded corners, label “A: real” in bold black (≈22 pt).   2. Right button: pastel-pink background, rounded corners, label “B: AI” in bold black (≈22 pt).  • Under each button, draw a thin horizontal arrow pointing outward (to the global bottom border of section 1):     – Arrow below green button is light-green and labeled “P_A > P_B” in small black text.     – Arrow below pink button is light-pink and labeled “P_A < P_B”.  SECTION 2  (green dashed border, titled “Model Pool”): • Place a light-green title bar at the top with the words “Model Pool” in bold black (≈22 pt). • Below the bar, vertically stack three model names, evenly spaced, center-aligned, each with its brand logo to the left:    1. InternVL V2.5  – pair the wordmark with the InternVL triangular swoosh logo in blue.   2. InternVL V3    – same logo and style.   3. QwenVL 2.5     – use the purple triangular Qwen logo.  • Between sections 1 and 2, draw a thick horizontal gray arrow pointing right to signal the image fed into the model pool.  • At the bottom of this section, add a narrow orange rounded rectangle that touches the section’s border, containing the text “Output Judge” in white bold font (≈18 pt).  SECTION 3  (blue dashed border, labelled “LMM”): • The top of this section is a light-steel-blue header strip. Centered on the strip, display the acronym “LMM” in big dark-blue sans-serif (≈24 pt). On the right side of the header, attach a small beige trapezoid labeled “LoRA” in italic dark-red with a tiny flame emoji to its right. • Directly below, render a horizontal row of 10 equal-sized rounded squares representing token embeddings:    – Squares 1-7 are alternating pastel-yellow and pastel-green.     – Square 8 is pastel-yellow.     – Square 9 is pastel-red and marked “logits_B”.     – Square 7 (the first green after the yellow sequence) is labeled “logits_A”.     Use slim black text beneath the specific squares to place the labels “logits_A” and “logits_B” with arrows pointing downward.  • Under the embedding row, draw a large royal-blue rounded rectangle labeled “Softmax()” in bold white (≈20 pt). • Below “Softmax()” place two vertical output arrows:    – Left arrow (black) points down to the symbol p_A^(i) in black italics.     – Right arrow (black) points down to the symbol p_B^(i).     Annotate “× N” to the far right of these two arrows to indicate multiple evaluations.  YELLOW EQUATION STRIP  (attached under SECTION 3): • Enclose this in a thin yellow dashed rectangle running the full width of the blue section. Inside, write in black mathematic-style serif font (≈18 pt):    P_A = Sum( p_A^(i) )     P_B = Sum( p_B^(i) )     i = 0, 1, …, N  GLOBAL STYLISTIC DETAILS: • All dashed borders: 4 pt stroke, matching each section’s theme color (purple, green, blue, yellow). • Arrow heads are solid triangular, stroke matching arrow color. • Shadows: subtle soft-gray drop shadow (3 px blur, 2 px offset) beneath every major rounded rectangle for depth. • Fonts: primary sans-serif for labels, casual handwriting font for the central question. • Background: pure white canvas. • Overall dimensions: approx. 1510 × 622 pixels, crisp retina quality, vector lines.”"

The whole illustration must have a playful but still academic style—clear, flat colors, black outlines, rounded shapes, hand-drawn-cartoon icons, and a friendly comic-like sans-serif font (similar to “Comic Neue” or “Patrick Hand”) for every text element.   Global palette:   • Paper-white background (#FFFFFF) covered by a 30 %-opacity diagonal hatch pattern: light warm-yellow lines (#FFEC8B, 3 px thick, 45 ° angle, spacing 14 px).   • Primary stroke color for boxes & arrows: medium-gray (#444444, 3 px, rounded caps).   • Accent colors to highlight concepts: tomato red (#FF595E), leaf green (#3CB371), sky blue (#00A6FB), apricot orange (#FFB347), royal purple (#B06CFF).    OVERALL LAYOUT   Aspect ratio ≈ 3:2 (wider than tall). Place a large rounded-corner rectangle (stroke = 4 px, radius = 24 px, color #FFB347) almost filling the canvas but leaving 30 px margin on every side. This rounded frame contains every internal element and inherits the diagonal yellow stripe pattern of the background (i.e., the pattern is continuous inside and outside the frame).  TOP HEADER   1. Centered, 50 px below the top frame edge: title text “Reasoning Stage 2: Cognition” in a bold, dark-mustard color (#C59A00), font size ≈ 66 pt.   2. Immediately right of the title, align a cute bulb-on-brain icon:      • Bulb: outline #C59A00, interior #FFF77A, subtle shine.      • Brain: coral pink (#FF8E8E) with three lobes, black outline.      • Icon height ≈ 64 px.    DASHED FUNCTIONAL BORDER   Inside the large orange frame, draw a secondary dashed rectangle (stroke #444444, 3 px, dash 10-8, radius 18 px) inset 36 px from the orange border. This dashed box encloses all cognition content.  MAIN LABEL ON TOP RIGHT OF DASHED BOX   At the top mid-right edge of the dashed box write in mustard bold 36 pt: “Judgement & explanation for anomaly”.  STEP 3 SECTION  (upper half of dashed box)   A. Section header      • Left-aligned at 40 px from dashed border, text block:        “Step 3:” above “Shallow Cognition” (on the next line).        “Step 3:” in bold 44 pt black. “Shallow Cognition” in italic bold 44 pt black with underline.   B. Icon + caption row beneath header (height ≈ 120 px)      • Left of the text, stack three small icons vertically on one invisible column:        1. Green check badge (solid #3CB371 circle with a white ✓).        2. Red cross badge (solid #FF595E circle with a white ✕).        3. Simplified robot head: light-gray body (#E0E0E0) with two black square eyes and a small cyan mouth (#00D9FF).        Each icon diameter ~36 px, 16 px vertical spacing.      • Right beside these icons, the caption “Cognize the phenomenon” in 36 pt black.   C. VISUAL CUES STRIP (occupies full width)      • Draw a horizontal light-gray rectangle (fill #FFFFFF) with dashed outline (#444, dash 7-7, radius 8 px). Height 100 px, width 90 % of dashed box. Center it horizontally 20 px below the previous row.      • Inside, create a 5-column grid:  (each column name uses 32 pt black)        1. “Visual”        2. “Cues”        3. “Spatial”        4. “Location”        5. A small rectangle 90 px × 60 px that depicts a tiny image thumbnail: use a street-surveillance snapshot with a red bounding box over a person (to hint abnormal event). Place black border around thumbnail.        6. “Abnormal Event Description” text spanning two merged cells to the right in 32 pt black, vertically centered.        7. To the far right a clipboard icon:           • White sheet with black border.           • Blue header stripe (#00A6FB) and a red square bullet within.      (The row therefore visually moves from “input cues” to a written description.)  D. ARROW FLOWS      • From the VISUAL CUES STRIP, draw a thick curved arrow (stroke #444, 4 px, arrowhead) going upward-right into a rectangular label “Explanation”.      • Another arrow, same style, goes upward-right toward “Anomaly Recognition”.      • A vertical arrow drops from the right of VISUAL CUES down to the next major subsection, labeled “Anomaly category”.      • Along this vertical arrow, display a color legend stack of three small horizontal bars (20 px × 8 px) in red, orange, blue to represent categories; label “Anomaly category” (30 pt black) flush left of the bars.  E. EXPLANATION & ANOMALY RECOGNITION BOXES      • Two sibling rounded rectangles (stroke #444, radius 12 px, 2 px thick) float on the top-center of dashed box, just under the header tagline.        1. Left rectangle 200 px × 80 px: text “Explanation” (34 pt black) with an icon of a seated scientist at desk using a monitor, plus speech bubble.        2. Right rectangle 270 px × 80 px: text “Anomaly Recognition” (34 pt black) and an icon of two stylized detectives shaking hands (one brown, one blue clothes).  STEP 4 SECTION  (lower half of dashed box)   A. Section header (left-aligned like step 3) 40 px below bottom of VISUAL CUES strip:      • “Step 4:” bold 44 pt black.      • Next line “Deep Cognition” italic bold 44 pt black with underline.   B. Icon + caption row      • On the left: a gray closed book icon (#BFBFBF) with white label stripe, stacked above the same robot head used earlier.      • Right to icons: “Cognize the essence” in 36 pt black.   C. CONTEXT BOX      • Centered under the caption row: a large dashed rounded rectangle (stroke #444, dash-7, radius 8 px), width 75 %, height 120 px.      • Inside split into two equal halves by a dotted vertical line.        Left half header: “Violation of Norms” (34 pt black) + icon: three stylized busts side-by-side, center one with a green check shield overlay (#3CB371).        Right half header: “Consequences” (34 pt black) + icon: broken blue road sign (#00A6FB) leaning on pole with bandage stripe (#FF595E).   D. At the very bottom center of dashed box, write: “Further understanding for anomaly” in bold mustard (#C59A00) 40 pt.  ARROW BETWEEN STEP 3 & STEP 4      • A thick vertical arrow connects from the bottom of the VISUAL CUES strip to the top of the CONTEXT BOX. Color #444, 4 px, arrowhead, straight.  TYPOGRAPHY RULES   • All main body black text use pure black (#000000).   • Underlines are solid 2 px black.   • Keep consistent font sizes stated above.    FINAL TOUCHES   • Apply a subtle drop shadow (opacity 20 %, y-offset 6 px, blur-radius 12 px) to the entire dashed inner rectangle to lift it from the background.   • Ensure all icons have 3 px black outlines.   • No gradients; only flat fills.   • Everything should look neat, balanced, and evenly spaced, mirroring the hierarchy and flow of reasoning from shallow cognition to deep cognition."

t2i_image_caption_167="Prompt (supply exactly as written to the image-generation system)  “Create a crisp, high-resolution vector infographic (approx. 16:9 aspect ratio, 300 dpi) that visualizes a secure RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) service workflow. Use a tidy, professional style with rounded rectangles, soft drop-shadows, pastel background panels, thick black outlines on icons, and a clean sans-serif font such as ‘Helvetica Neue’ (all label text in bold for titles, regular for annotations). Colors: #d3e4ff (very light blue) for general backgrounds, #e6f4e6 (mint) for authorized components, #f8f8f8 (light gray) for unauthorized components, #fce7e7 (very light pink) for warnings, black text, green #31a847 for ‘authorized’ arrows, and red #c92222 for ‘unauthorized’ arrows.   1. Leftmost vertical strip (80 px wide, full height):     • Pale cream (#f5f5e8) column labeled ‘User’ at top in 28-pt bold dark gray.      • Stack five evenly spaced flat-style icons, each 64 px square, centered horizontally:       a. Cloud server rack (black frame, blue and white server lights, a small cyan cloud in front).       b. ‘API’ cloud: cyan cloud icon with the text ‘API’ in white, and four royal-blue downward network lines ending in purple circles.       c. Desktop PC: steel-blue monitor with black bezel, light-blue screen, gray tower to right.       d. Laptop: teal laptop with darker teal keyboard, light-blue screen.       e. Smartphone: navy phone body, light-blue screen, small cyan ‘API’ cloud identical to (b) overlapping lower left corner.   2. Immediately to the right, two horizontally aligned, vertically stacked rounded rectangles (corner radius 18 px, stroke 3 px black, width about 240 px, height 90 px each) inside a larger mint-green (#e6f4e6) panel (stroke 4 px darker mint, subtle drop-shadow). Panel header text at top center: ‘Authorized RAG Service Provider’ in 30-pt dark forest-green (#2b8b2b) bold italics.     • Upper inner rectangle: light beige fill, label ‘Generator’ (24-pt black bold) at right; to the left, OpenAI‐style swirl icon in charcoal gray.     • Lower inner rectangle: identical size, label ‘Retriever’; to the left, magnifying-glass icon with sky-blue lens and walnut-brown handle.     • Between the User column and each of these two rectangles, draw solid black right-pointing arrows (width 3 px) entering the rectangles’ left edges.   3. Directly right of the mint panel, place a large pale-yellow vertical cylinder (height 230 px, width 140 px, black outline) labelled ‘Knowledge Base’ (26-pt black bold) centered on the curved top face. Inside the cylinder, show three manila file folders (cartoon style, with cute smiling faces) lined up horizontally, each containing a lavender document with a tiny watermark icon (blue droplet symbol) in its upper right corner.      • From both ‘Generator’ and ‘Retriever’, draw double-line green (#31a847) right-angle arrows (label under each arrow in 16-pt italic dark gray: ‘usable but not visible’) that join into the cylinder’s left face. These arrows consist of two parallel 2 px strokes spaced 6 px apart.      • To the right of the cylinder, midway vertically, add a thick solid black right-pointing arrow labeled ‘Contribute’ (22-pt bold navy) that points into a vertical “Data Provider” strip described in step 5.   4. Beneath the mint panel, create another large rounded rectangle (same width, 320 px tall, stroke 4 px black) filled #f8f8f8. Header text top center: ‘Unauthorized RAG Service Provider’ in 30-pt bold bright red (#c92222). Inside, do NOT insert any modules, leaving a mostly empty interior to emphasize lack of legitimacy. Place a red no-entry sign (circle with diagonal bar, yellow scroll behind) 80 px tall centered inside the panel.       • From the User column, draw two solid black right-pointing arrows that feed into the left side of this unauthorized panel (aligned with the two input arrows above), maintaining identical style.      • From the lower edge of the Knowledge Base cylinder, draw a dashed red (#c92222) arrow (stroke 4 px, dash length 10 px gap 6 px) bending down 90°, then right into the unauthorized panel. Label the arrow midway, in 18-pt bold red: ‘Unauthorized Commercial Use’. Add a small cartoon hand clutching a stack of golden coins at the arrow tip.   5. Rightmost vertical strip (same width as User column, #d3e4ff background), top-to-bottom center-aligned title ‘Data Provider’ in 28-pt bold navy at top. Stack four flat-style icons, each 64 px square, evenly spaced:     a. Corporate office building in royal-blue with a yellow shield-check-mark emblem.      b. Hospital building in white with a large red cross and dark doors.      c. Person at a laptop: smiling coder icon, mint shirt, light laptop.      d. Group of four stylized head-and-shoulders avatars (diverse skin tones), celebrating with sparkles above.    6. Watermark-probe annotation boxes (dashed rectangles, black 3 px stroke, no fill, 3 px corner radius):     • One such dashed box surrounds a horizontal path above the mint panel: arrow labeled ‘Watermark probe Query’ (16-pt black italic) running from the Knowledge Base leftward, looping up, then right into the Data Provider strip. At the point just before entering the Data Provider strip, include a bright-green circular badge with white checkmark and adjacent text ‘Authorized Use’ (22-pt bold #31a847). Beneath, in emerald-green italics, write ‘Watermark Detected’.     • Mirror this arrangement below, between the unauthorized panel and cylinder: identical dashed box with arrow labelled ‘Watermark probe Query’ leading rightward. Near arrow tip, place a red circle with white ‘X’ icon and text ‘Unauthorized Commercial Use’ (22-pt bold red). Beneath, italic crimson text ‘Watermark Detected’.   7. Add a horizontal legend bottom center:     • Green parallel-line mini arrow with caption ‘usable but not visible’ (16-pt forest-green).     • 30 px gap, then red dashed arrow icon with caption ‘Unauthorized Commercial Use’ (16-pt crimson).   Ensure all arrows have arrowheads, all text is crisp, and overall visual hierarchy is clear. Maintain consistent icon style (flat with a subtle dark outline) and color coding for immediate readability.”"

Overall layout: one large, portrait-oriented rounded-rectangle frame (black 5 pt stroke, 25 px corner radius) that encloses the entire flow-chart. Outside the centre-top of this outer frame, draw a thick, solid black downward arrow (stroke 6 pt, arrow-head height ≈25 px) whose tip touches the top edge of the frame, indicating the pipeline entry.  Inside the top edge of the outer frame, centre the title text:     ‘Data collection and preprocessing’ Use a playful, rounded handwritten font (e.g., Comic-like, bold), pure black, font-size ≈46 pt. Align the baseline horizontally, leave ≈20 px margin above the title before the inner content begins.  Below the title, stack four process modules vertically. Each module is a light-blue dashed-outline rounded rectangle:     • stroke colour: #3A8DCE,     • dash pattern: 10 px dash / 6 px gap,     • stroke width: 3 pt,     • corner radius: 18 px,     • interior fill: fully transparent. All four modules have identical width (≈75 % of the outer frame’s inner width) and consistent vertical spacing (≈35 px between neighbouring boxes). Left-align the module group with ≈40 px padding from the left inner wall of the outer frame; leave ≈180 px clear column on the right for a vertical annotation column (described later).  Connect the four modules with mid-aligned vertical arrows:     • arrow shaft: medium-grey (#555555) 4 pt line, length ≈28 px,     • arrow-head: filled equilateral triangle, base width ≈14 px, same colour,     • position: centred between the right and left borders of the module group.  MODULE 1  (top):     • Internal icon: a cartoon wooden paintbrush tilted 30 ° counter-clockwise; place the icon outside the module’s left border, centred vertically to the box height. Brush handle orange (#E69A00), bristles beige (#F5DEB3), 3 pt black outline.     • Module text (centre-aligned, two lines):          line 1: ‘Data Merging’          line 2: ‘and Formatting’       Typeface: the same handwritten font as the title, bold. Colour: dark mustard yellow (#B49500). Font-size ≈30 pt.  MODULE 2:     • Left-side icon: a blue funnel; rim width ≈22 px, stem length ≈35 px, icon sits exactly like the first icon. Funnel fill: gradient from light-blue (#80C4FF) at top to darker blue (#0073B6) at bottom; 3 pt black outline.

Right-hand vertical annotation column:     • Draw a tall, narrow rounded rectangle (height spans from slightly below title to slightly above bottom of module 4). Outline: dashed (same dash style as modules), stroke 3 pt, colour #3A8DCE, corner radius 18 px, transparent fill. Offset: 20 px inside the right border of the outer frame.     • Place at its top a group-of-people icon (three stylised smiling heads, comic style). Heads left-to-right colours: magenta (#FF2D92), coral red (#FF5151), lavender (#A179FF). Circular heads 30 px Ø, minimal shoulders, 3 pt black outline.     • Write the vertical label inside the column, rotated 90° clockwise so the baseline runs bottom-to-top. Centre the text horizontally in the column:         ‘Annotation Team          (50 Annotators)’       ‘Annotation Team’: olive-green (#4F8127); ‘(50 Annotators)’: gold-ochre (#B49500); same handwritten bold font, each word capitalised; when rotated, approximate font-size ≈30 pt. Ensure the text is visually centred between the top icon and the bottom of the column.  Outer-frame right-edge arrow:     • A thick black line (6 pt) begins at the top-right corner of the outer frame, runs down outside the frame parallel to it, ending in a triangular arrow-head that stops flush with the bottom edge of the outer frame, visually implying continuation. Arrow-head width ≈22 px.  Leave uniform 35 px white margin around the outer frame to the page borders. Use consistent black outlines (2 – 4 pt) for all icons and module boxes to provide a cohesive cartoon-scientific aesthetic. Output everything as crisp, flat-colour vectors—no blurry gradients except the subtle funnel gradient."

Section 1 – “Centralized RAG” (left third): • A bold, black, center-justified title bar reading “Centralized RAG”, placed beneath the legend, spanning only this panel width. • Inside, stack two dashed-outline rounded rectangles (stroke #666, 2 pt).   1) Cloud-Only block (bottom): dashed box filled with very light slate-blue tint (#EAF0FF, 15 % opacity).        – Top left inside the box: a blue OpenAI swirl.      – To its right: a 3-layer server rack icon (silver/gray).      – Centered arrow curving clockwise from swirl to server.      – Directly under them: a vertical black arrow pointing down into a large black circle with white “+”.      – From that circle, a thick black horizontal arrow points right into a 4-sheet paper stack icon (white pages with pale gray outlines), Google “G” magnifying-glass emblem in lower left corner of the stack.      – Beneath the dashed rectangle, a small sans-serif caption “Cloud-Only” (centered).   2) Device-Only block (above Cloud-Only, same size, same style but fill light butter yellow tint #FFF8E0, 15 % opacity).        – Blue/ochre OpenAI swirl at top left is ochre here.      – At top right, a gray laptop icon (lid open 90°).      – Clockwise arrow swirl between them.      – Same “+” circle and arrows arrangement, but the right-hand resource icon is a golden cylinder database symbol with a tiny magnifying glass overlay.      – Below this rectangle the caption “Device-Only”.  • Overlapping the top of the two dashed boxes, two genre/game strings appear in italic serif font, 60 % gray:   – On the Cloud side, left-aligned inside margin: “puzzle¹” on line 1, “Rusty Lake²” on line 2, both left-tilted italics.   – On the Device side, similar style: “simulation¹” on line 1, “The Sims²” on line 2, slightly darker.  Section 2 – “Distributed Retrieval” (center third): • Title bar identical style: “Distributed Retrieval”. • Under title bar, italic gray text lines, left-aligned near top margin: “simulation¹” then “Stardew Valley²”. • Directly below, a rounded light-gray pill button containing a clock icon at left and label “long wait” in dark gray. • Main dashed rectangle (stroke 2 pt): left half tinted very-light slate-blue, right half tinted very-light butter yellow (vertical split 50/50).    – Left half: 4-page stack with Google icon, arrow into central black “+” circle.    – Right half: ochre OpenAI swirl above gray laptop; small black downward arrow feeds from swirl to laptop; thick black arrow from central “+” circle into a gray document icon with a padlock overlay (privacy lock). • Beneath box: no extra caption.  Section 3 – “Distributed RAG” (right third): • Title bar: “Distributed RAG”. • Italic gray metadata text identical to section 2 (“simulation¹”, “Stardew Valley²”). • Around the main inner graphic is a larger dashed rounded rectangle (stroke 2 pt) labeled “Aggregate” in dark gray, centered at the top inside the border. • Inside this aggregate boundary are two side-by-side sub-boxes (left tint light slate-blue, right tint light butter yellow) sharing a central horizontal black “+” circle:    – Left sub-box: blue OpenAI swirl above gray server stack; downward arrow from swirl to server; right-facing arrow from server into the central “+”; under stack a small 4-page Google stack icon.    – Right sub-box: ochre OpenAI swirl above gray laptop; downward arrow; left-facing arrow into central “+”; under laptop a golden cylinder database with magnifier. • From the top of each sub-box, two thin black upward arrows exit, pointing toward small blue (left) or ochre (right) OpenAI swirl icons outside the dashed area, visually indicating results aggregation.  Bottom sentence banner (full width, occupying remaining canvas height): • A horizontal white strip outlined in black containing the fill-in-the-blank sentence in large, black, serif font:   “I like ① ____ games, among which ② ____ is a hot seller on Steam.”   – ① and ② are in bright sky-blue circles with black outline (numbered 1 and 2). • Right corner of this banner: a small decorative illustration of a person wearing a beret and hoodie, sitting at an open laptop with a speech-bubble tail pointing left.  Render the character in monochrome blue (#7FA9E6) line art style with flat shading; do not depict facial details.  Overall typography: • Titles in bold black small-caps sans-serif. • Body labels in regular sans-serif. • Footnote exponent numerals “¹” and “²” superscript. • Dashed strokes: 6 px dash, 4 px gap. • All arrows solid black, cap style round, width 2 pt.

Inside, arrange six circular nodes (~80 px diameter) on a slanted diamond-shaped topology:        Row 1 (top, centered): mustard-yellow node “chat setup”       Row 2 (slightly lower, left offset): same yellow “chat exec”       Row 2 (right aligned): lavender-purple node “img setup”       Row 3 (left): sky-blue node “cc setup”       Row 3 (right): lavender node “img exec”       Row 4 (bottom centre): yellow “chat exec”     Node colors:       • Yellow: #e7d299       • Lavender: #d2c2e3       • Blue: #c7d9f0    Draw directional black arrows:       chat setup → chat exec → cc setup → cc exec (blue node at Row 4)       chat setup → img setup → img exec → chat exec (bottom)       chat exec (Row 2) → img exec (Row 3)       cc setup → chat exec (bottom)    All arrows emerge neatly from node rims.  4. Center-right column (x≈870–1210 px):    a. “Execution Engine (§3.2)” rounded rectangle, pastel mauve fill (#d8c8e9), width≈330 px height≈200 px, divided by a thin internal border into a 2×2 matrix of equal sub-boxes (≈150×90 px each):       • Top-left: “DAG Scheduler”       • Top-right: “Resource Orchestrator”       • Bottom-left: “Executor”       • Bottom-right: “System Monitor”    b. Directly beneath, slightly overlapping/down-connected by a thick black vertical arrow, place “Hardware Resources” rounded rectangle (width≈330 px height≈120 px, pale butter-yellow fill #f4efcf).  Inside, a horizontal trio of square icons with captions:       • Left: stylized blue GPU chip icon with lightning bolt; caption “GPU”       • Centre: silvery CPU chip outline; caption “CPU”       • Right: blue stylized memory sticks; caption “RAM”    c. Left side of Execution Engine box receives a left-to-right arrow from the dashed DAG region; overlay circled ‘3’ on that arrow.    d. Right side of Execution Engine yields a right-pointing arrow carrying circled ‘4’ toward the reporting box.  5. Far-right column (x≈1240–1660 px):    a. Tall white rectangle with bold black border, width≈280 px height≈340 px.    b. Internally split by one horizontal rule into two equal parts.    c. Upper part title “App Report” (bold).  Bulleted text below:          Chatbot:            TTFT, TPOT            SLO Attain          ImageGen:            Per-step Time            SLO Attain          …    d. Lower part title “System Report” (bold).  Bulleted text:          GPU Util          CPU Util          …  Miscellaneous stylistic instructions:  • Maintain consistent 14 pt font for headings, 11 pt for node labels, 10 pt for bullet text. • All pastel fills at 30% opacity relative to full color for a subdued look. • Background of entire page pure white. • Align elements so centerlines of columns form visually pleasing vertical stripes; keep 40 px horizontal gutter between columns. • Ensure arrows never overlap text; reroute with slight bends if necessary but keep mostly straight."
